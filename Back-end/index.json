I discuss:\nTrends in the short vs. long term\nThe current truth: financial incentives are driving growth. \nThe opportunities and execution risks for crypto games that aim to be fun.\nFinancialization of Fun\nFinancializing fun is a path that traditional gaming is already on; people can trade skins and make money as streamers and professional gamers. Crypto just takes this to the next level. Currently, I see two major categories emerging:\n1) \u201cPlay-first\u201d crypto games where the fun gameplay takes centre stage and crypto is used as a competitive edge to engage players further.\n2) \u201cEarn-first\u201d crypto games where the main allure, gameplay and fun ultimately come from earning money by participating in crypto game economies.\nBoth types of games can hit at the core of why people play: games allow people to fulfill their basic desires in ways that bring them more gratification with lower hurdles than fulfilling them in real life (see: Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs). Said another way, humans enjoy playing the same life games in parameterized and alternate realities. The most popular games capitalize on mimetic desire and simultaneously shape desires while creating the in-game loop to satisfy them. \n\u200b\u200b\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\nPlay to Earn. Earn. Earn.\nThe current leading game in crypto, Axie Infinity, achieved a $35B valuation ($AXS) despite many gaming experts criticizing the gameplay for not being fun. Yet, dedicated players can earn up to thousands of dollars per month and low-income players (especially in the Philippines who make up 40% of players) have flocked to the game in search of economic opportunity. \nAxie and its dozens of clones imply that perhaps fun isn\u2019t what\u2019s key for a crypto game to grow, but rather gameplay mechanics that reward players with real-world earnings. Illuvium, another game that won\u2019t be launching for another 2 years, has found itself with an $11B valuation ($ILV) driven largely by introducing a pre-game token and staking mechanics. \nThe early traction for current P2E games begs questions like: \nHow much do people care about the core game itself? \nDoes their potential to earn and the market value of their NFTs matter most? \nMore fundamentally, if money is the end point, is it truly a game or just a gamified micro-economy where \u201cfarming crypto\u201d is a core game mechanic? \nWhile this sounds like a gaming cardinal sin, in many ways, crypto investing and trading could be thought of as the internet\u2019s largest Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) and, for many, it\u2019s deeply addictive and fun. \nForecasted timing: earn-first games vs play-first games\nEarn-first games: economy-centric through crypto\nIn the short term, this sector of crypto gaming will see the fastest growth and an influx of competitors due to shorter development timelines, a rush of investor capital into surrounding guilds and asymmetric returns that bring flocks of new players. \nEarly traction for earn-first games\nCrypto games that are centered around earning as opposed to gameplay are quicker to market since token incentives bootstrap and maintain the interest of players and speculators. \u201cSuccessful\u201d games will likely trade with high speculative premiums as investors and traders clamour to have a stake in the next big P2E winner. For crypto-natives, they\u2019re particularly exciting to invest in (whether they\u2019re fun or not) because these games experiment with crypto concepts like NFT flipping, airdrops, staking, farming and the ownership economy. \nWhilst these crypto-native games try to be first and foremost fun, one look at their users and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s the earning opportunities that drive player growth. For players of these games, the game blends with work and investing; there\u2019s a calculable opportunity cost to their time and strategy when they consider which NFTs they have to buy, to play which game, to farm which token. \nThe proliferation of crypto guilds, communities and esports leagues around these earn-first games are evidence that earning opportunities are key to these games. Guilds like YGG and Merit Circle (which just raised $100m+) only exist and are trading at large premiums because of the earning opportunities that are offered within the earn-first games they\u2019re centered around. If you\u2019re bullish on the current gaming guilds, by extension, you\u2019re also bullish on games where earning takes centre stage and the play to EARN component is most critical. \nPitfalls\nEvery game sets out to be genuinely fun. However, builders must remain pragmatic about who their current user base is, why they\u2019re playing and who their primary target audience will be. At this stage, crypto games typically target two primary audiences with some overlap: traditional gamers and people who are there for crypto. If a game\u2019s marketing and distribution strategy centres around crypto exchanges, token launch platforms and guilds, they are not targeting traditional gamers despite their spoken desire to. Most crypto games, at current, are targeting crypto enthusiasts and low-SES players incentivised by the earning opportunities (which is still a large and growing audience). \nMost games won\u2019t cross the adoption chasm from the early market (crypto enthusiasts) to mainstream market (traditional gamers or low-SES players). Nonetheless, games like Axie are paving the way for others to cross over to a large population of people who want to earn by playing games. \nThe Chasm in the Technology Adoption Lifecycle \nMeanwhile, some developers will spend years trying to rival a AAA game to target the mass gaming community, but it\u2019s possible that crypto games that see early success simply embrace crypto-native principles where people can have fun by earning. A huge potential pitfall is sinking months to years developing a game with both mid-tier gameplay and uncompetitive earning opportunities. It\u2019s possible that instead of trying to mimic the fun in traditional games, builders in this space could just focus on creating a minimum viable game with a focus on nailing fun P2E mechanics.  \nDoes the music ever stop?\nGames where earning is at the core are also inheriting a difficult sustainability problem. It\u2019s impossible to create an economy that constantly grows. Axie earnings have already started to decline, which will soon make the game undesirable for their current player base who are primarily playing to earn. If new entrants cannot win and turn a profit, Axie will experience a recession since their growth will no longer outpace inflation. The hundreds of guilds that are built around Axie action will also suffer. It\u2019s unlikely that pivoting to try to make the gameplay \u201cmore fun\u201d is going to solve this incoming problem since the majority of their user base plays for financial incentives. \nThe daily earnings of a typical player have fallen below the Philippines\u2019 minimum wage line for all except high ranking players, and even they have seen earnings decline since August. \u2013 Lars & Naavik Research\nThat being said, these sorts of economies with embedded inflationary ponzinomics can actually be sustained for longer than people think, especially when there\u2019s an influx of venture capital vying to invest in the next big P2E hit. In a similar vein, online casino games like poker and slot machines are still games that focus on earning and they make up a multi billion dollar industry that has sustained for decades. While not exactly identical to gambling, the earn-first crypto games we are seeing blend the desire to earn with finance and game-like mechanics.  And, whilst these earn-first games might not linearly evolve and displace traditional gaming, they could innovate and forge their own path and business model that makes it possible to sustainably have fun from earning. \nTo wrap up this section, I don\u2019t think the current iteration of crypto games are going to simply unlock the \u201cnext step in gaming\u201d or a paradigm shift within the industry. In the near term, the emergence of crypto within gaming will look less like an evolution of traditional gaming but a completely different path. While financial incentives are currently bootstrapping player interest, games that use crypto to unlock gameplay mechanics that are fundamentally new will be better positioned in the long term. \nMuch like how DeFi protocols can\u2019t just rely on inflationary tokenomics and yield to sustain their product, games that are first and foremost fun to play without being crypto-first are strong contenders in this space because they can stand alone as a product.  But these games will have some lag time before we see more of them come to market because they take longer to develop and come with a host of execution risks. More below. \nPlay-first games: fun gameplay with crypto \nIn the medium term, we\u2019re going to see more gameplay-first games launch with crypto concepts and innovations. These innovations will happen along a spectrum from cosmetic skins becoming NFTs to token models where gamers can play for ownership in a game. \nThe first few iterations will see developers try to force P2E concepts, tokens and NFTs into very traditional-looking games. I predict P2E as a concept will be experimented heavily with over a 2-5 year horizon. However, I believe longer term, we\u2019re going to see developers use crypto to unlock entirely new gameplay mechanics. For example, games could introduce creative concepts like a dynamic NFT that mimics wear and tear or build a game from bottom-up using user generated content (see: Loot). At the end of the day, crypto is a huge sandbox for games to experiment with.\nThis is what will unlock a new golden age for gaming. With great graphics, interesting stories and lure that incites emotions, these games can leverage crypto in new and exciting ways that enhance feelings of achievement and keep players more engaged. \nOpportunities\nCrypto also creates new forces within the gaming landscape. Within traditional gaming right now, there are key stages of the game creation value chain where most of the industry\u2019s profits are generated. Crypto flips the incumbent business model, free-to-play, on its head by allowing companies to monetize in almost any stage of game creation. Most notably, games can monetize and bootstrap community funds before the game is even created. In fact, traditional games are designed first with capitalization in mind with a couple main models: buy-to-play, free-to-play, and subscription. Changing the revenue model for games is what will be most exciting and new. Without free-to-play games, we wouldn\u2019t even have esports as we know it. \nAt the same time, crypto also enables another type of participant alternative to the conventional gamer: the gaming enthusiasts, collectors and money-makers. These people are not necessarily playing the games but can be supporting the space by taking other sides of trades, betting, attending events, watching streams, speculating and collecting gaming memorabilia. Crypto can enable these new types of actors that have emerged on the periphery of gaming to actually contribute to the future of the game in novel ways.\nSimilarly, there\u2019s the opportunity (and double edged sword) to empower gamers to own their in-game achievements, items and, essentially, financialize their fun. Whilst ownership is not a strong desire that the majority of gamers have woken up to, it just takes one successful crypto game to make gamers question why they weren\u2019t always owning their in-game assets. However, there are also risks.\nRisks\nWhile crypto and gaming sounds like a promising match, crypto-enabled games aren\u2019t going to go mainstream simply because experienced game developers are working on them. In fact, introducing crypto for many of these games, is going to be a self-defeating endeavour and an extremely difficult design problem due to the limited understanding (and experimentation) around how crypto interfaces with gameplay. \nAnd even then, these crypto-games can\u2019t just have AAA graphics, they need to beat incumbents at their own game. Even if a game nails the crypto-economics, if it\u2019s mediocre it will at best poach users from other crypto-first games without making a dent on the 200B online gaming industry. I believe that the games that end up succeeding over the next decade are the ones that use crypto to unlock fresh gameplay mechanics instead of simply forcing P2E mechanics into the same traditional games we see today. \n\nCurrently, the best games simulate and parameterize the same life games we play but with guardrails or in closed economies. Financializing parts of the games through tokens or NFTs removes a major guardrail that fundamentally changes the gameplay and opens games to inherit the full financial landscape of the \u201creal\u201d world. Very few traditional game developers have experience designing and controlling gameplay/gamer psychology when the game becomes exposed to the forces of speculators, investors and arbitrageurs who have their own out-of-game incentives that move around the game\u2019s token and NFT prices. The first step is acknowledging this reality and purposefully designing the game with these different forces in mind.\nWhile many will try to supplement knowledge gaps with crypto-native VCs/advisors who tout they can handle the tokenomics, in reality, the one-in-a-million game is going to be a result of crypto-natives working hand-in-hand with experienced game developers/economists to take a \u201cplayer first\u201d approach to solve difficult design problems. Builders should look for partners who help flag the many opportunities and externalities that crypto brings to their game.\nIntroducing ownership and monetary value affects gamer psychology\n\u201cOwnership\u201d (especially through NFTs) has become a buzzword and it\u2019s easy to forget that the main reason games tokenize assets is because it introduces monetary value or makes the asset more composable. If you ask traditional gamers, they still believe they \u201cown\u201d their assets even if they\u2019re not NFTs. While most crypto games currently use NFTs as a store of value, NFTs can also be designed for other creative purposes like building identities across different games or sharing them with your friends. \nTokenizing in-game assets introduces a difficult design problem because adding monetary value to game assets risks negatively affecting gameplay. For example, when Diablo 3 added real-money auction houses (to trade game assets for money), some players loved it but the game ultimately saw a hemorrhaging of players.

For example, when Diablo 3 added real-money auction houses (to trade game assets for money), some players loved it but the game ultimately saw a hemorrhaging of players. The auction house is a case study on how financializing game assets can short circuit the natural pace of item drops, making the game feel less rewarding for some players. It\u2019s a design problem that has yet to find a repeatable solution. For Diablo 3 players, introducing monetary value changed how and why people played. Players who used to play for fun found themselves starting to play for rent. The underlying psychological shift caused players to stop enjoying the playing itself, and to quit to play other games that didn\u2019t invoke the real world so heavily. \nThe Diablo III real-money auction house\nGame psychologists note that a lot of the joy and addiction comes from unexpected and randomized rewards. The ability to easily acquire a known reward with money might actually rob the games of what makes them fun. The direction of NFTs and many P2E games are fast racing towards pure financialization which could ultimately kill core gameplay. Especially for avid gamers, this quickly becomes a cardinal sin when people have the opportunity to pay-to-win by bankrolling to acquire material advantage in a competitive game. \nTraditional gamers are fixated on the meritocracy of gameplay skill which makes the addition of tokens/NFTs (and the real world complexities they bring) extremely difficult to nail. If not done \u201cright\u201d the traditional gaming community will always be quick to disparage anything that doesn\u2019t fit their sense of what a game is and who should be playing it. These sorts of games should err on the side of tokenizing cosmetic skins (not ones that affect gameplay to avoid pay-to-win dynamics) and consider using non-transferable tokens so that only gamers can \u201cmine\u201d by playing the game.\nThe takeaway: new developers hoping to build mega games with P2E mechanics need to be very careful to weave in cryptoeconomic incentives and NFTs in a way that maintains the quality of gameplay or they risk both botching the gameplay AND the incentives for P2E players. Moreover, crypto-native game developers have a blue ocean opportunity to create a new generation of games that leverage crypto in ways that go beyond just adding a token or tokenizing in-game assets. These types of games take longer to develop, but once a couple get the recipe right, there\u2019s a real chance that they onboard billions of traditional gamers into crypto. \nConcluding thoughts\nIn the end, I believe that crypto will unlock a paradigm shift in gaming. Though it\u2019s still unclear what exactly that shift will look like, I believe that, in the short term, we\u2019ll see earn-first crypto games like Axie and Zed Run create a black hole by onboarding players using financial incentives. Supplementing this growth will be guilds and DAOs on the periphery. In the medium term, we\u2019ll see traditional-looking play-first games experiment with new monetization models using tokens and NFTs while attempting to onboard both traditional gamers and earn-first gamers. And, in the long-term, we\u2019ll see a new generation of gaming that uses crypto that goes beyond just adding P2E mechanics. \nFor game developers looking for creative risk, this is a prime blue ocean with attention and capital on the sidelines ready to be deployed. Crypto opens a world of innovation beyond adding tokens or simple NFTs; it allows game developers to create a new class of games built around the design freedoms that crypto affords and a new cast of game players where professionalization, earning and ownership is directly embedded into the gaming experience. \nRegardless of your opinion on these different segments, they will all have an interrelated future in gaming; these games will crossover, learn from each other and work together too. If you\u2019re building towards this future, we want to hear about it. \nBig thank you to the Mechanism team for reviewing and refining (Marc, Brian, Ben, Andrew) as well as Brooks, Zaheer Ebtikar, Ben Rameau and Kenny for their comments.\nNothing above constitutes investment advice.\n\n\n\u2014----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBreaking the Trance: Crypto Gaming\nAuthor: Eva Wu\nJune 7, 2022\nToo many founders are in a trance and the broken premise goes something like this: \u201cFor years, gamers have been pouring hard-earned money into games with nothing in return. Thanks to crypto, players can earn NFTs and tokens that have real value. Anyone can and will be entitled to earn for having fun because they\u2019re helping the game to succeed!\u201d  \nUnfortunately, crypto isn\u2019t a magical solution that rains money on everyone.  It\u2019s time we reconsider the \u201cearn\u201d philosophy that underpins so many short-lived game economies. Previously, I\u2019ve categorized crypto games into earn-first and play-first and, as we conclude the first chapter of crypto gaming, I\u2019ll be exploring those terms again with further the discussion on why Play and Earn is leading us astray, a better business model for earn-first games, and designing the future for play-first games.\nPlay and Earn is leading us astray\nPlay and Earn is the hopium label that describes games with players who grow fond of games first and then earn rewards. In reality, much like its predecessor \u2014 Play to Earn \u2014 these games weigh heavily on \u201cearn\u201d and use short-lasting financial incentives to mask their lack of genuine players.  The first problem starts with the name itself; using the \u201cearn\u201d label is poor branding and is akin to calling Poker \u201cPlay-and-Earn Card Game on a Table\u201d instead of allowing the game to shine. Yet most games create their first impressions through an X-and-Earn tagline. Most importantly, the pervasiveness of the word \u201cearn\u201d has been encouraging games to build fated-to-fail economies and attract yield-seekers over true gamers.\n\nWhen gamers are told to \u201cplay\u201d and then \u201cearn\u201d, it sets an unrealistic expectation that results in constant sell pressure on a game\u2019s native token. Games economists might be better off revisiting whether \u201cPlay and Earn\u201d makes sense at all instead of spending most of their time thinking about how to add better sinks, more taxes, and counter the sell pressure. At the very least,  games should consider removing  \u201cPlay and Earn\u201d from their vocabulary in favor of words that actually explain what they\u2019re making.  Otherwise, they may find themselves at the mercy of players with unrealistic financial expectations, an unstable economy, and poor branding.\nPaying players in perpetuity \nThe philosophy that most players should be earning is an unhealthy obsession that we need to address because, alas, it is unsustainable to pay the average player in perpetuity. \n\nNo matter how many sinks are added or how much money a token or NFT collection raises, if the embedded assumption and selling point is to pay most players, the economy will soon lose its balance.  Video games, crypto or traditional, need to take care of their economic flows. The difficult truth is that any game that gives out a traded token or NFT is paying players with money that comes from someone. Game creators, enticed by terms like \u201cplayer-owned\u201d, have been grossly overpaying early users with a negative customer lifetime value in hopes to build a loyal community. These early players are mostly speculators and farmers who provide the inflow of cash that represent the flash in the pan success we\u2019ve seen for different games. However, the capital spent on NFTs and tokens have been rather mercenary; if it doesn\u2019t net more money, it leaves the ecosystem. So, not only are games overpaying for mercenary players but they\u2019re scaring away gaming hobbyists: those who play and spend primarily for the game and its inherent fun. Besides, if players expect more money than they put in, are they really an asset or a liability? The net losers will continue to be game creators and token/NFT investors who are late to the party. (I\u2019ve included a more detailed breakdown on who ends up paying crypto game rewards in the Appendix)\nIs the game play-first or earn-first?  \nFounders must remain vigilant of the difference between the game they want to make and what they actually make. There are many games who have convinced themselves of creating a play-first game but have all the goal posts, outward marketing and strategies of an earn-first game. A good litmus test is the ratio between the number of game-related vs. crypto-related tweets. Game developers looking to build in the space should be aware of one of the most common traps: the idea that games can start by targeting earn-first players and somehow pivot into a  play-first game. While it\u2019s attractive to be able to hit shallow metrics earlier, the idea is flawed because the momentum from monetary rewards turns off players who want less financialized games, meanwhile, halting or reducing rewards also turns off earn-first players. It\u2019s analogous to new blockchains that try to build first and decentralize later; it usually doesn\u2019t happen.\nSomething similar occurs in Free to Play gaming too. Games are either built for microtransactions or built for fun; one comes first and the other is conditioned by the former. Fortnite, for example, was an entirely free game first. It was a mod of Fornite 1.0 and added as a joke to their launch and it took off. Monetization was added after the fact. Games like Farmville are created with the monetization loop first and the gameplay is then fit within it. However, it\u2019s almost always the case that there is no game inside (h/t Brooks Brown). In other words, if the game is \u201cearn, first\u201d\u2026 it\u2019ll be earn-first. \nIf games want success within a shorter timeline, they\u2019d probably have better luck building an earn-first crypto game, today. However, if games want to build a play-first game, they can either try to change the gaming community\u2019s hatred for crypto games or have their game ready for when said community capitulates their opinions. Going too heavy on financial rewards to bootstrap a higher DAU count is more likely to hurt a  play-first game in the long run. \nA future for earn-first games  \nIn order for an earn-first game to succeed, earning must take center stage. The quest for earning is entertainment. Throughout history, people have always drawn entertainment from the potential of earning money; straight earning makes our dopamine system go crazy. In general, these sorts of players are fine with equating any small amounts lost to a night out\u2019s entertainment. \nIn the short term, we\u2019ll likely see more X-to-Earn projects try to mimic StepN\u2019s short financial success. While it\u2019s undisputed that these games don\u2019t have staying power, ponzi-like games will always exist fueled by willing attention. Why? Because they\u2019re quick to spin up, not serious, and pretty fun until you lose money. Said differently, the quest for earning is entertainment. Besides, every game has a shelf life, some are just (much) shorter than others. \nFor games with a longer shelf-life, they\u2019ll likely follow tried and tested business models like those in eSports or casino games. Generally, earn-games can sustain if it\u2019s solvent enough to pay out rewards. This could come from:\nPlayers who are willing to pitch into a pot of rewards\nSponsors who want to host a game\nSpectators who want to tip or bet from the sidelines \nAny other users that can be taxed to cover the reward payout\nPoker and sports are helpful analogies for earn-first games: people will be able to play earn-first games both socially and competitively, companies will sponsor pots and host tournaments, players can make money as micro-celebrities or by winning pots, coaches will be paid to teach, talent will be paid to make the equipment and speculators will watch, tip and bet on games. This sort of economy holds better because there\u2019s a direct and understood exchange of value be it between players, sponsors, or spectators. This model embraces that people are there to earn and spend. These are games where earning is the goal, not the afterthought; they will leverage the thrill of money as the core loop and build a separate economy around it. \nWhat about the future of play-first games? \nOver the past year, we\u2019ve tried to make \u201cearn\u201d the killer attraction for play-first games to no avail. We\u2019ve yet to prove how crypto makes a traditional game better and have, instead, overly financialized every aspect. In this section, I share some high-level frameworks that might help us design smarter game economies. \nThe game vs. the financial game\nFirstly, introducing a token at any point introduces an inescapable financial game. Traditionally, games simulate the same life games we play but with guardrails and within closed economies. Introducing a token or NFT removes a major guardrail and opens it up to inherit the full financial scape of the real world. Of course, there are players who love the financial metagame, however, gamers should be able to play whichever game without being tricked into playing someone else\u2019s. \nOver the past year, we\u2019ve observed poor outcomes from blending these two games so closely. For example, Axie was an adorable turn-based strategy game on the surface but by blending NFTs and tokens into their game, players flocked over for the financial game instead. What they were really playing was an earn-first game with pyramid-scheme-like mechanics; every player joining was fronting the NFT cost in hopes to be a seller before everyone else and to make money from the time put into playing, earning, and selling SLP and Axies. When earning cash is too intertwined within a game, it becomes the natural scoreboard and motivator rather than the game itself.\nWith that in mind, perhaps the future is finding a way to separate the game from the financial game. Either way, next generation game developers will need to find novel ways to connect crypto and its embedded financial game to complement their game without it overpowering the game. \n\nA useful analogy is the Pokemon card game; it exists separately as a trading card game and as a financialized collector\u2019s game. Similarly, in sports, money and an economy flows around the game but it does not affect the sport itself. It would be off-putting for most sports if players chose where to move and how to hit a ball based on how much money each move could earn. A player\u2019s mind should be on the game, on playing, and not on outside forces like money. This is what makes play-first games distinct from their earn-first counterparts. \nAn economy that props up play  \nPlaying is not the same as being involved in a game and, as time passes, it\u2019s", "doc_id": "e796dff4-e095-4855-bccc-c7cab98a0068", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4d4e50b34e0df63d9d44f8ffab41655ad7a8da67e689bf9610de470631f117a6", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 14661, "end": 29925}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "10761cf2-7727-40cf-98cc-2b7f20231f05", "3": "31c46521-1a5d-46f1-99d9-03233f8981ec"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31c46521-1a5d-46f1-99d9-03233f8981ec": {"text": "need to find novel ways to connect crypto and its embedded financial game to complement their game without it overpowering the game. \n\nA useful analogy is the Pokemon card game; it exists separately as a trading card game and as a financialized collector\u2019s game.

It would be off-putting for most sports if players chose where to move and how to hit a ball based on how much money each move could earn. A player\u2019s mind should be on the game, on playing, and not on outside forces like money. This is what makes play-first games distinct from their earn-first counterparts. \nAn economy that props up play  \nPlaying is not the same as being involved in a game and, as time passes, it\u2019s becoming more apparent that the innovation within crypto gaming might be less about rewarding players and more about rewarding those who drive value to the game and its players. In many ways, game creators play the role of a central bank and treasury; setting reward schedules is strikingly similar to taking tax dollars and choosing how to spend or distribute them. The analogy also conveniently describes how players are the losers when a game over-inflates its native token. With this in mind, game developers should consider only rewarding actions that directly or indirectly generate a greater financial return and increase the GDP of their ecosystem. Currently, most game economies have 30-60% of the total token supply set aside to reward every sort of player in the ecosystem (see left). However, a vibrant economy should instead empower people to exchange goods and services with each other (see right). \n\nInstead of using treasury funds to force a game economy, games should aim to create ecosystems where there\u2019s a creation and direct exchange of value between its gamer base. This would support the token towards becoming a real medium of exchange. For example, if games want designers to create worlds, the system should reward shared interest for creators to get a direct cut of future profits.  Similarly, instead of \u201cinfluence-to-earn\u201d business models where games pay influencers, games should favor a model where successful influencers have willing fans who tip and pay them. \nIn this way, people can get rewarded multiple times over for the creation of virtual goods and services instead of farming for upfront and unsustainable rewards. Moreover, this direct exchange creates real earning opportunities for people who are willing to pay and fosters a more efficient economy. After all, a game economy is a complex, real economy. And like real economies, they\u2019re prosperous when there\u2019s strong employment and a growing GDP.\nFinal thoughts\nLast year, there was an enormous tide of retail and investor money vying for the next crypto game. As the tide rolls out, we want to make sure we\u2019re not left naked; we have to confront the assumptions we made during a distracted state where numbers only spiraled up and to the right. It\u2019s time to break the trance around \u201cPlay and Earn\u201d and paying players in perpetuity; we need to sober up about the inescapable financial game crypto brings and design smarter game economies. \nI hope this piece helps game developers to take a step back from the noise and reconsider how they\u2019re building their crypto games. As I wrap up my writing, I find myself being critical yet optimistic about what could unfold.  If you\u2019re building something and also find yourself in such a state, I\u2019d love to talk and bounce ideas.\nThank you to Zaheer, Nicholas, Shual and Nix for their comments and suggestions and to Brooks who has helped shape and battle test my thinking.\nAppendix I: Breakdown of potential sponsors for mega game rewards\nCohort \nWho Are They\nAre they paying?\nGame Players\nThose who play and spend without expectation of return. \nNo, we have yet to reach game-market-fit with this audience. \nEarners/ Game Extractors\nPlayers who want to earn over play.\nNo, most players have been trying to extract financial value from the game and leave when the opportunity isn\u2019t there. As a cohort, they have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of these game rewards. \nGame Creators\nThe team behind the development of the game\nYes, game creators have both created monetary value for their token and also given it out for free. In hopes to create a \u201cplayer-owned\u201d economy, they have been paying out and sponsoring the rewards.  \nLiquidity Providers\nThose who provide the market for people to buy in and out of the token. \nYes, often game creators themselves, this cohort has been the exit liquidity for those who want to cash out. They lose economic value when people sell and do not make money when the price goes up. \nInvestors \nPeople who buy the token in private or public markets\nYes, earlier investors might help games to get started but later investors who buy the token with the expectation of price going up often buy out earlier gamers or investors.\nToken Holders \nAnyone who holds the token (team, investors, prospective gamers and traders) \nYes, holders of an inflationary reward token are being taxed every day as the team issues more shares at the same market cap. Unless players are pocketing that inflation and there is constant demand at the current market cap, they are losing value.\nSimilarly, holders of a fixed supply token are also at the mercy of low float (high fully diluted valuation) token and increasing sell pressure as more gamers/extractors get rewarded tokens they can sell. \n\n\u2014----------------------------------------------------\nToken Value Accrual\n\nVader Research\n\u00b7\nFollow\n\u00b7\n42\n3\nToken Buyback & Burn, Staking Rewards, Incentives and More\n\nThe underlying business is growing and receiving payments \u2014 how to accrue value created to the token entity so token holders can benefit from the existing or future success of the underlying business? What are different mechanisms to accrue value and what are their pros & cons?\nWe answer all those questions in this piece. We have a 3-step approach at Vader Research on token value accrual:\nStep 1: Define Inflow Channels\nStep 2: Determine Inflow Payment Currency\nStep 3: Determine Value Accrual Mechanism\nWe will cover:\nWhat is Value? How is it Created?\nStep 1: Define Inflow Channels\nStep 2: Determine Inflow Payment Currency\nStep 3: Determine Value Accrual Mechanism\nBonus: Value Accrual Timing\nWhat is Value? How is it Created?\nValue = Revenue or Volume. We talk about value accrual in our token cap table allocation piece. Anything that represents existing or future revenue represents value.\nIn other words, value is created through inflows to the ecosystem. These inflows may be in any currency (stablecoin, L1 blockchain, native token) and can accrue 100% (primary NFT sale, upgrading fees, etc.) or X% (secondary royalty fees) to the protocol.\nE.g. Crypto Vnicorns sells 100 primary NFTs for $1m. Assuming the proceedings go to the token entity, the token entity accrues $1m worth of inflows regardless of the currency of the sale (which might have been in USDC, ETH or the native Crypto Vnicorns token).\nE.g. Degen A buys $100k worth Gigidaiku NFT from Degen B. Gigidaiku creator Kimit Break charges 10% royalty fee on all secondary transactions. Assuming the proceedings go to the equity entity, Kimit Break accrues $10k worth inflows regardless the currency of the sale.\nWhether these inflows should be recognized as revenue or not (due to the time period where the value is created or to the payment currency) is the problem of accountants not us. We are concerned about designing a sustainable NFT economy, efficient allocation of resources and measuring the effectiveness of business decisions.\nRevenue is a tricky and abstract concept that can be recognized based on various subjective parameters such as the payment currency and the period when the revenue is actually \u201cearned\u201d. E.g. If Adam pays $120 for a 1yr Netflix subscription upfront, $10 will be recognized as revenue in month 1 and $120 will be recognized as cash inflow in month 1. Additionally, payment received in a protocol\u2019s native currency might not be recognized as revenue.\nFor our modeling purposes, we prefer to use inflows rather than revenue \u2014 inflows are closer to a traditional accounting cash flow inflow (cash flow statement) than revenue (income statement). However we also include non-stablecoin flows such as inflows in non-stable currencies and outflows in native tokens or non-native currencies (NFTs, etc.) in our adjusted inflow statement table.\nThe traditional 3 financial statements, valuation methodologies (DCF), KPIs (retention, DAU, LTV, CAC) do not directly apply to web3. They all need to be adjusted to more accurately represent the health and performance of a web3 protocol. At Vader Research, we have been working on proprietary statements and metrics to better account for value creation and accrual.\nStep 1: Define Inflow Channels\nWe explained inflows above. Now let\u2019s look at some of the common inflow channels and web3 examples\nSome of the common inflow channels seen in games are\nPrimary one-off NFT sale of in-game characters, items/weapons or land\nOngoing primary NFT sale (breeding/minting/crafting)\nUpgrading/Repairing/Energy Fee\nBattle Pass\nWagering/Tournament Buy-In Fees\nAlthough games give a sense of control to players by enabling players to \u201cmint\u201d or \u201cbreed\u201d the NFTs, in reality the prices are set by the developers (or DAOs and inflows are going directly to the protocol. Some of these NFTs might be permanent or consumables. Consumables NFTs are likely to be sold more frequently, resulting in more sustainable and recurring inflows.\nAxie Infinity Classic Inflows:\nPrimary NFT Sale\nPrimary Land Sale\nBreeding Fees \u2014 Breeding fee is sort of an ongoing primary NFT sale. Breeding cost caps the NFT price, so whenever the secondary market NFT price is higher than the breeding fee, there is an arbitrage opportunity for anyone to breed/mint a new NFT.\nRoyalty Fees \u2014 Secondary marketplace transaction fees.\nSkyweaver:\nConquest Entry Fees\nRoyalty Fees\nPrimary Non-Card NFT sale (Hero Skins, etc.)\nSplinterlands:\nPrimary Card NFT Loot Box Sale\nCard NFT Upgrading Fees\nRoyalty Fees\nTournament Organizer Fees\nSTEPN:\nPrimary NFT Sale\nMinting Fees\nRepairing/Upgrading Fees\nRoyalty Fees\nEthereum:\nOn-Chain Transaction Gas Fees\nStep 2: Determine Inflow Payment Currency\nOne or multiple payment currencies should be determined for every inflow channel. The end user could have the option to choose a currency among all options or could only have 1 option. The inflow currency decision making process should consider end user experience, treasury inflow diversification, value accrual and legal/regulatory topics.\nThere are 3 common payment currency options:\n1. Stablecoin (USDC, USDT, $, \u20ac, etc.)\nStablecoin is the most convenient option for end users as they don\u2019t need to deal with additional friction points such as exchanging stablecoin into another currency on a decentralized or centralized exchange.\nAdditionally, fiat-to-crypto on-ramp tools such as Moonpay enable the end users to make payments directly with their credit cards without setting up or connecting a Metamask wallet. This is critical as a good % of users drop out throughout the payment funnel due to additional friction points. The fewer the friction points, the lower the dropout rate.\nThat said, stablecoin payments might cause legal problems as there are regulations in certain jurisdictions that disincentivize players to make payments in stablecoins.\n2. Blockchain Currency (ETH, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, IMX, etc.)\nUnderlying blockchain\u2019s token is the 2nd most convenient option for users. Since users need to hold the underlying blockchain\u2019s token to pay gas fees for any on-chain transaction, users are assumed to hold a minimum amount of these tokens. Additionally, most centralized exchanges have direct blockchain currency deposits/withdrawals to non-custodial wallets such as Metamask.\n3. Native Token (AXS, GMT, MANA, GALA, SLP, etc.)\nThe protocol\u2019s native currency is another option. It is more inconvenient for the end users since they must go through the additional friction points mentioned at option 1. That said, it gives a concrete utility for the token and trains the end user\u2019s subconscious mind to purchase the token (admittedly this argument has no scientific backing).\nThe payment currency can be made in one or two native token(s). Axie\u2019s breeding cost was paid in both AXS and SLP so players had to hold a sufficient amount of both tokens to execute the breeding transaction. Making protocol-related payments in the native tokens provides a real \u201ccurrency\u201d utility for the token.\nStep 3: Determine Value Accrual Mechanism\nOnce the inflows are defined and payment currencies are determined, we can now explore the options to accrue value to the token entity. Keep in mind that not all inflows necessarily need to accrue to the token entity. Some developers would like to accrue value to a mix of equity entity, other token entity and various classes of NFTs.\n\nAxie\u2019s breeding cost is a great example of value accrual to multiple entities. There are 2 main inflow sources; marketplace fees and breeding fees. 100% of marketplace fees accrue to a wallet address controlled by the AXS token entity. X% of breeding fees are paid in SLP which are automatically burnt \u2014 accruing value to the SLP token entity. 1-X% of breeding fees are paid in AXS which accrue to a wallet address controlled by the AXS token entity.\nAxie NFT owners can earn SLP through play-to-earn rewards and Land NFT owners are able to earn AXS through staking. In other words, value accrued to SLP indirectly accrues to Axie NFTs whereas value accrued to AXS indirectly accrues to Land NFTs. There are many other parameters such as what % of AXS staking rewards are reserved for Land NFTs, what is the breeding cost, what % of breeding cost is consisted of SLP vs AXS and whether Axie NFTs are permanent assets.\nLet\u2019s look at token value accrual options in each inflow currency:\n1. Inflows Received in Stablecoin or Blockchain Token\nA. Buyback the Native Token\nToken buybacks are very similar to share repurchases. The token entity purchases native tokens from the open market through a centralized or decentralized exchange. Value is accrued to all token holders on a pro-rata basis as the circulating token supply that is being traded is decreased.\nBuybacks can be executed in regular intervals and fixed figure \u2014 e.g. use 70% of monthly stablecoin inflows to buyback the native token OR buybacks executed on a non-regular basis to have a more dynamic treasury management.\nB. Distribute Stablecoin or Blockchain Token to Users\nThe inflows are used as marketing/engagement spend and are recycled back to the economy to incentivize specific actions with the aim of boosting growth/retention/monetization and creating long-term value. Unlike option 1,", "doc_id": "31c46521-1a5d-46f1-99d9-03233f8981ec", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "20b1bc6d3065ecf3fd6f6850b015045ddb1631cbdf239cd90b5f614777def6dd", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 29978, "end": 44907}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "e796dff4-e095-4855-bccc-c7cab98a0068", "3": "3c68470c-c169-45a0-86fd-99f99d9036eb"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c68470c-c169-45a0-86fd-99f99d9036eb": {"text": "Token\nToken buybacks are very similar to share repurchases.

Distribute Stablecoin or Blockchain Token to Users\nThe inflows are used as marketing/engagement spend and are recycled back to the economy to incentivize specific actions with the aim of boosting growth/retention/monetization and creating long-term value. Unlike option 1, value is accrued to active protocol participants rather than the token holders in the short term with the expectation that this will yield larger benefits in the longer-term for the token holders.\nC. Distribute Stablecoin to Stakers (similar to dividends)\nStaking rewards are very similar to dividends. The token entity airdrops stablecoin or blockchain token to token holders. Value is accrued to staking token holders on a pro-rata basis as the token holders end up with more monetary assets than they were before the staking rewards. This model can be further enhanced by distributing a higher % of tokens to token holders that timelock their stake longer.\nA good practice could be a blend between all options. Executing small buybacks while distributing stablecoin or blockchain token rewards to users that are eligible due to protocol activity & native token ownership could be an effective way to distribute rewards.\n2. Inflows Received in Native Token\nA. Burn Native Tokens\nReduce maximum token supply by permanently burning X amount of tokens from the circulation. The burn can occur automatically as inflows occur, regularly on a monthly/weekly basis or arbitrarily based on developer/DAO decision. Value is accrued to all token holders as the maximum token supply is now lower.\nB. Recycle Native Tokens to Users\nThe inflows are used as a marketing/engagement spent and are recycled back to the economy to incentivize specific actions with the aim of boosting growth/retention/monetization and creating long-term value. Unlike option 1, value is accrued to active protocol participants rather than the token holders in the short term with the expectation that this will yield larger benefits in the longer-term for the token holders.\nSince the monetary incentives are in the form of the native token currency to loyal/engaging users, this can potentially be considered as a better currency for rewards than stablecoin or blockchain token as % of native token reward-earnings users who don\u2019t sell the native token will likely be higher than the % of non-native token reward-earnings users who go to a centralized or decentralized exchange to buy the native token.\nAdditional frictions to sell the native token DISINCENTIVIZES users from selling the native token while additional frictions to buy the native token DISINCENTIVIZES users from buying the native token.\nC. Distribute Native Tokens as Staking Rewards\nStaking rewards are very similar to dividends. The token entity airdrops native token rewards to token holders. Value is accrued to token holders on a pro-rata basis as the token holders end up with more native tokens than before the staking rewards.\nD. Hodl Native Tokens\nInstead of burning tokens immediately or redistributing them back to users/stakers, hodl the tokens in the treasury entity and make the value accrual decision later. Compared to simply holding native tokens in the treasury, burning native tokens gives additional trust to retail investors that there is a tangible, measurable token burning mechanism.\n\nBonus: Value Accrual Timing\nOnce a publicly traded company generates earnings and accumulates cash, it can use the cash in 3 ways:\nInvest back in growth/marketing/operations\nPay dividends to shareholders\nBuyback shares\nIf management decides that the business is mature enough and there are not attractive business investment opportunities such as hiring new employees, building a new line of service or spending more on marketing, then management can decide to distribute the excess cash back to the shareholders.\nTypically, early-stage or fast-growing startups do not pay dividends to their shareholders. They rather reinvest earnings back into growth via user incentives, subsidies or further marketing spend. Facebook was founded in 2004, became profitable in 2009, went public in 2012 and has never paid any dividends. Amazon was founded in 1994, went public in 1997, became profitable in 2001 and has never paid any dividends.\n\nThese are still relatively fast-growing companies compared to mature businesses such as those in oil&gas or industrials. Facebook and Amazon executives would rather invest the excess cash to expand into new business areas rather than pay it back to shareholders as the longer-term value creation opportunity is much bigger than the short-term dividend payments.\nThe timing of short-term token value accrual decisions such as staking rewards, buying back native tokens or burning tokens is crucial. Token incentive rewards (whether in native token or another currency) is one channel for overall user acquisition and engagement. There are other strategies as well such as performance marketing, influencer marketing, tournaments, etc. Web2 startups employ a head of growth/marketing who tracks the cohort retention CAC and LTV metrics per acquisition channel to decide on the optimal marketing or incentive capital allocation.\nE.g.\nUsers acquired through FB ads cost $20 per user and returned $5 in LTV.\nUsers acquired through influencer marketing cost $10 per user and returned $12 in LTV.\nThen it is a no-brainer to pour in more marketing dollars to influencer marketing as long as the numbers stack up. The same comparison could be applied to token incentives but by making careful adjustments since token incentives are not always used for user acquisition but also for engagement and retention.\n\nUber has a dynamic incentive pricing model for drivers \u2014 taking a passenger from specific areas pay better than others and this pricing changes dynamically based on the traffic in that area, time of day, available Uber cars in the area and existing/estimated passenger demand. Uber wants to minimize the waiting time as a long waiting experience typically results in the passenger switching to other apps.\nThus, an early-stage crypto startup burning tokens or distributing staking rewards before the product-market fit is hit or even during a fast-growth period might not be an efficient allocation of resources. In the previous piece, we discussed why token vesting periods should be longer than they currently are.\nIf the token incentives do not result in a long-term benefit for the protocol, then it might make sense to reduce the size of token incentives and potentially exchange tokens for fiat/stable in order to finance other marketing/engagement/operational activities.\nConclusion\nValue creation is defined through ecosystem inflows and developers/DAOs should be able to determine what % of the overall value created should accrue to which tradable asset (native token 1, native token 2, NFT collection 1, etc.). The ideal token value accrual mechanism will depend on whether the inflows are received in the native token or another currency. The timing of value accrual is as important as the chosen value accrual mechanism.\nNone of this is financial or legal advice.

This has created opportunities for financially motivated actors to speculate and earn while also enabling game developers to incentivize certain player behavior with financial rewards. The complex open game economies have resulted in the emergence of new participant classes with varying motivations and behaviors \u2014 this article aims to classify these participant personas alongside the existing F2P participant personas.\u00b9\n\nF2P Players\n\nF2P players are the traditional video game players \u2014 they play games because they enjoy them with no expectation of financial rewards. Some F2P players are more valuable to game developers than others as they spend more on microtransactions or their eyeballs are worth more bucks to advertisers.\nF2P Whales\nF2P Whales are the creme de la creme \u2014 they spend huge sums of money in games on a regular basis. Whales enjoy paying for experiences associated with power, social interactions and more. They might represent the majority of a F2P game\u2019s revenue and due to their extravagant spending behavior, advertisers are willing to spend large sums of money to get access to their eyeballs to sell them various products/services. They can spend anything from $500 to $100k per month.\nF2P Mid-Spenders\nF2P Non-Whale Spenders are the type of gamers that are desired in a healthy long-term economy. Even though they don\u2019t spend as much as the whales, they are likely to spend relatively more time playing the game than whales and still spend a considerable amount of money. They are likely to spend on battle passes, microtransactions and cosmetics. They can spend anything from $5 to $100 per month.\nF2P Non-Spenders from Developed Countries\nF2P Non-Spenders are those that do not spend in games but due to their disposable income, their eyeballs are valuable to advertisers. There is also a possibility that they can convert into a spender anytime. The gross advertising revenue that the game could generate from an average non-spender player from developed countries could be $5-$20 per month.\nF2P Non-Spenders from Developing Countries\nF2P Non-Spenders are those that do not spend in games. Additionally, their eyeballs are also not very valuable to advertisers as the average non-spender player from developing countries is considered to have little disposable income and a relatively lower probability to convert into a spender. The gross advertising revenue that the game could generate from an average non-spender player from developing countries could be $1 per month.\nIn short, most F2P players have a net deflationary impact on the economy as they are willing to spend more money than what they are getting paid by the game (if they are getting paid anything).\nCapital Providers\n\nWeb3 Gaming Guilds\nLet\u2019s start with some facts. The existence of any for-profit institution is to make money \u2014 institutions don\u2019t have emotions (and ethics). Founders, executives and some shareholders might have emotions but they also have a fiduciary duty to their share/token holders to maximize franchise value. Thus, they will always have to prioritize a decision to maximize profits/value over supporting ethical causes.\nA brand might appear to support ethical causes (environment, peace, racial/gender equality, etc.) but in reality, it probably is a well-constructed PR campaign because the executives came to the conclusion that the financial & social costs of supporting a specific ethical cause will result in a ROI positive investment that will lead to higher customer & employee retention & monetization, resulting in higher franchise value.\nWeb3 Gaming Guilds have financial motivations and aim to allocate their capital, time and labor to maximize earnings and franchise value. Guilds buy & lend in-game NFTs to gold farmers to earn a yield and invest in early-stage game tokens/NFTs with the expectation of capital appreciation.\nEven though guilds spend as much as F2P whales, unlike F2P whales they don\u2019t have physiological motivations and will likely not spend on cosmetics, IAPs, battle passes unless they can justify the investment with a positive financial ROI.\nThe reasoning is simple; A VC-backed guild with a publicly listed token has fiduciary duties to its institutional & retail token holders to maximize earnings and long-term fully-diluted market cap. Thus it can\u2019t waste fiduciary money on buying game cosmetics for personal physiological motivations of its executives.\nA guild that makes $ millions in profits from a P2E game might then buy cosmetics from that game \u2014 but this will be a PR strategy to appear supportive and non-extractive to get access to more early-stage game token/NFT investment opportunities.\nOne exception of guilds being deflationary and non-value extractive for any game economy is the zero-sum wagering model. E.g. Guild A bets $10, Guild B bets $10 \u2192 winner guild earns $18, game dev earns $2, loser guild earns nothing. The growing popularity of this model through various token engineering has led guilds to invest heavily in their esports teams.\nAnother exception of guilds being inflationary and extractive could be whether guilds act as a deflationary player acquisition channel \u2014 similar to an influencer. So that the earnings that guilds extract from the game could be justified by the earnings they bring through their brand & distribution channels. Another exception is guilds becoming UGC creator/developer agencies/bootcamps as discussed by Carlos Perreira.\nAdvertising value that a game can generate from a guild is typically low because although guild owners have high disposable incomes, the ones that are playing the games and watching the ads are scholar guild members who typically have low disposable incomes and are from developing countries.\nCrypto VCs & Hedge Funds\nCrypto VCs & Hedge Funds are institutionalized investors; they have financial motivations and aim to have an exit price that is higher than the entry price. The time horizons and asset preferences may vary; VCs might prefer early-stage private tokens/equity and have a 2\u20133 year horizon while Hedge Funds might prefer tradable tokens/NFTs and have a 1\u2013180 day horizon. These institutions are typically not very active within the game itself. In short, these are the institutions that provide capital and look for opportunities & inefficiencies within the market.\nRetail Speculators\nRetail speculators have similar financial motivations to that of the previously mentioned institutions. Retail speculators can either act collectively by being part of a chat group, community/forum, DAO or they can be individual lone wolves.\nNFT & IDO Whitelist Hunters are constantly looking for the next big gamefi investment, do extensive due diligence on the projects, spend hours engaging on the Discord channels to get whitelisted for the next hot game\u2019s primary NFT sale.\nPonzi Yield Enjoyers enjoy getting into ponzis where there is an estimated high juicy yield on their investment; projects they have previously invested in could be Axie Infinity, Thetan Arena, OHM, Luna, STEPN. They are likely aware of where the yield is coming from,", "doc_id": "3c68470c-c169-45a0-86fd-99f99d9036eb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ae36ac281308bbe1165fab136251f508472979ff76bcc7db0b0701e935f34ca2", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 44878, "end": 60356}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "31c46521-1a5d-46f1-99d9-03233f8981ec", "3": "6e769cc0-2459-4583-a197-a34e69c83d79"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e769cc0-2459-4583-a197-a34e69c83d79": {"text": "Speculators\nRetail speculators have similar financial motivations to that of the previously mentioned institutions.

They are likely aware of where the yield is coming from, enjoy the thrill & high returns and bet that the music will continue playing.\nMoonshot Traders make bets on various tokens, NFTs with the aim of generating very high returns from the difference between the entry and exit price.\nEven though individuals mainly have financial motivations, they might not be the most rational investors and will likely have a high tendency for gambling/wagering since they are already willing to invest considerable amounts in risky crypto projects. A well-designed game economy would be able to convert financially motivated retail speculators into deflationary players for the game economy.\nPaid Players\n\nGold Farmers\nGold Farmers have purely financial motivations \u2014 they play the game to make money. Their decision making process to play the game is a function of how much $ they can earn per hour, what the effort required is and what the probability of earning is. If driving an Uber earns them a guaranteed $5 per hour and playing Axie to earn a risky $3 per hour \u2014 they might choose driving an Uber.\nUnlike F2P players who go through the core game loop and are willing reinvest back the physiological/financial rewards back in to the game to go through the full loop or progression, gold farmers are interested in earning the financial rewards as soon as possible so they can cash out and extract value from the economy.\nInstitutionalized Gold Farmers are even a bigger problem for the game economies as they are a more organized and efficient form of individual gold farmers. They might pay a fixed salary to child labor in low-income countries or they might set up sophisticated bots. They will continue extracting value from game economies until there is no profit to be made.\n\nSource: What Killed the MMOG?\nCompetitive Players\nCompetitive Players are the skilled players that are constantly on the top of leaderboard rankings in a game. They don\u2019t necessarily have financial motivations and don\u2019t play the game solely to earn money. Most of them start as F2P players but as they progress throughout the game and do well, they rank up and start earning through winning tournaments or through streaming.\nAs they start building a personal brand, they might get poached by esport teams to start working for them in return for a stable salary and additional perks. However, like any professional sports, the average plaer\u2019s earnings will be limited to the size and spending behavior of the audience that is willing to watch the sports.\nNBA and soccer players make millions of dollars per year because there is a large audience willing to spend hundreds of dollars per month on satellite TV to watch them. However, badminton or squash matches don\u2019t have the same magnitude of audience spending \u2014 thus professional badminton players are getting paid much less than professional soccer players.\nThe same applies for esports \u2014 even though the number of esports viewers of a top esport tournament can be more than FIFA World Cup\u2019s, the magnitude of spending per average esport viewer is significantly lower than that of the average soccer viewer.\nThat said, competitive players aren\u2019t necessarily inflationary for the game economy as their existence attract new players, additional engagement for existing players (through streaming or playing together). One model where competitive players can be truly deflationary for the game economy is the zero-sum wagering model where competitive players are willing to put their skin in the game and bet on their own skills.\nMicro-Influencers & Content Creators\nMicro-Influencers & Content Creators represent a strong distribution channel for games. Influencers attract, engage, retain players through numerous activities. They build a community of engaged members who have strong faith in their community leader which results in the influencer promoting new games/products to his audience to have a very high conversion ratio.\nUnlike competitive players that earn mostly through tournaments mainly financed by the game developer, influencers typically earn from advertising new games/products/services. An influencer\u2019s performance to promote a game can be relatively easily measured and thus the market will continue rewarding influencers that have an economically net positive (deflationary) impact for the game economy.\nWhite Collar Paid Players\nWhite Collar Paid Players are a new player type described in detail in our Night Clubs & Web3 Games article. They have strong social skills and their existence result in increased retention & spending for players that interact with them which is why even though they might get paid, their overall impact is deflationary.\n\nSource: Night Clubs & Web3 Games\nConclusion\nApart from making an entertaining game with strong core loops, great art and balanced rule sets; the biggest challenge for web3 games will be sustaining an open economy, allocating financial incentives optimally while keeping the players/community happy to maximize LTV.\nHaving a permissionless open economy inevitably attracts financially motivated participants who aim to extract more value from the game than they add. Web3 game developeds should carefully evaluate which player types they would want to have in their game. Thus, the game economy and rule sets should be designed to reward/punish certain participants and behaviors.\n\u00b9This classification is based on qualitative analysis, observation and user research. It is likely that as we gather more on-chain and off-chain player/speculator behavior data from existing & upcoming web3 games, we will be able to better understand and classify different player archetypes.\n\u00b2Deflationary means the player type bring more money flows to the game economy than it extracts. Inflationary means the player type extract more money flows from the game economy than it brings.\n\nNone of this is financial advice.

This piece wouldn\u2019t have been written without his input.\nLet\u2019s imagine a case where a crypto startup has raised capital from VCs for an equity entity and has future plans to raise further capital for the equity entity. The startup also has plans to launch a token at a future date. Let\u2019s assume that the majority of the overall value created by the protocol will accrue to the token entity instead of the equity entity.\nWe propose that either a) no tokens should be allocated to equity investors and team or b) tokens allocated to equity investors and team should have a very long vesting schedule.\nThe token allocation portion that was planned to be allocated to equity investors and team should rather go to the equity entity. And the equity entity shouldn\u2019t distribute the tokens to the shareholders until the underlying business reaches a maturity measured by certain business metrics.\nIf the above cannot be executed due to legal reasons, then tokens allocated to the equity investors and team should have a 10 years vesting schedule with the first token unlock starting at year 7. That said there should be pre-defined exceptions (KPI targets, acquisition) that would enable them to unlock their tokens earlier.\nWe are going to cover\nLonger Token Vesting Schedule Proposal\nProblem With Existing Token Vesting Schedules\nTraditional Early Stage Investing\nVC Model\nConclusion\nProposal\nLet\u2019s try to understand the above statement with examples. Below is how the equity cap table would look like pre-token launch based on the startup\u2019s fundraising plans.\nThe base assumption should be that 100% of protocol value accrues to the token entity -> obviously not the case, but anything less than 100% value accrual to the token introduces additional complexity that is hard to control for & weakens the proposal. Check our Token Cap Table article to better understand the value accrual concept.\n\nLet\u2019s say the startup raised a total of $20m in multiple fundraising rounds for the equity entity in exchange for 50% of the equity. Thus, the equity investors collectively own 50% of the equity entity. The equity entity is valued at $40m and the equity investors\u2019 stake in the equity entity is worth $20m ($40m * 50%).\n\nThe startup also decided to allocate 50% of the token allocation to the community and 10% to the treasury. The remaining 40% will be shared between the investors and team on a pro rata basis. Since the equity entity has a 50/50 ownership, the remaining 40% token allocation should also have a 50/50 distribution. Thus, the ideal token allocation would be 20% equity investors and 20% team.\nThe intrinsic fully diluted valuation of the protocol is $100m \u2014 $40m equity valuation divided by 40% (token allocation of team + investors). The investors\u2019 stake in the token entity is worth $20m (assuming the equity entity is almost worthless).\n\nHowever, we propose that the remaining 40% token portion that went to the investors and team should instead go to the equity entity.\nWhy?\nProblem\nBy far the biggest problem of token entities is that the pace & volume of token emitted to the circulation from the treasury is larger than the pace & volume of demand for the tokens from the market!\nToken Emission Growth < Token Demand Growth | Token Price \ud83d\udc46\nToken Emission Growth > Token Demand Growth | Token Price \ud83d\udc47\n\nVIS token price vs circulating supply\nThere are many ways to try solving this problem and this is a topic of another article but one direct solution relevant to this article is to delay the investor & team token unlock as late as possible.\nInvestor and team tokens are timelocked over a period of time. Once the tokens are unlocked, investors and team typically cash out immediately \u2014 which puts further sell pressure on the token price as the token supply emitted to the circulation becomes even larger.\nCrypto projects are early-stage protocols that use token incentives to bootstrap user liquidity. Tokens are constantly emitted to the users to incentivize protocol activity. Thus, there is already an existing inflationary pressure to sustain and grow the ecosystem. Investors and team selling their portion of tokens before the platform is sufficiently mature, results in further sell pressure.\nAdditionally, as the founders cash out the tokens before the product is launched, they graudally lose the motivation & incentive to ship the product. The short vesting periods incentivize founders to be good snake oil salesmen \u2014 focusing on marketing the token by selling dreams to retail investors for a product that will never be released rather than focusing on actually building the product and understanding the customers\u2019 pain points.\nThe same applies to investors; investors support the company and shill the token heavily until their vesting schedule ends. They then cut their ties with the company and don\u2019t support it anymore \u2014 they have little incentive for the business to be a long-term success. As long as the price is high when their tokens are unlocked, they are happy. This is where the private investor incentives clash with that of the founders & community.\nWe argue that the investors and team shouldn\u2019t be able to sell their stake until the platform reaches business maturity pre-defined by specific metrics. Doesn\u2019t matter whether it takes 5 or 15 years for the business to reach those metrics!\nLet\u2019s look at some vesting schedule examples from existing projects\nAXS (Axie Infinity)\n\nSource: AXS Whitepaper\nAXS private sale investors are able to unlock their tokens every 3 months over a 2-year vesting period starting from the launch date. AXS allocated 4% to private investors which is a significantly low figure compared to other projects but the existing vesting period is pretty short.\n\nHere\u2019s the AXS private investors\u2019 vesting period in detail\n\nTokens allocated to Sky Mavis (the equity entity) are unlocked over a 4.5 year period \u2014 at first glance this looks like a relatively long-term vesting period but the devil is in the details.\n\n19% of the Sky Mavis token allocation is unlocked on the day of token\u2019s launch. So effectively 4% of the total token supply is held unlocked by the equity entity. We do not know whether these tokens were held by Sky Mavis or distributed to team members or equity investors (who might have cashed out).\nYGG (Yield Guild Games)\n\nSource: YGG Whitepaper\n25% of YGG tokens are allocated to investors with a vesting schedule of a total of 5 years. However, ~30% of investor tokens are unlocked on the token\u2019s public sale date. Effectively, that is 7.5% of the total token supply! 2 years after the token is launched, ~80% of investors are unlocked. This is definitely not a long-term vesting schedule.\nTraditional Early-Stage Investing\nCrypto has enabled founders and investors to have early exits without even shipping a product by just selling a \u201cdream\u201d or an \u201cexperience\u201d to retail investors. Let\u2019s look at how exits in traditional early-stage investing work.\nVCs invest in a startup and cannot exit until i) the company goes public (IPO), ii) the company is sold. The path to exit can easily take 10 years based on data from Crunchbase.\n\nSource: Acuris\nThere is a third option \u2014 a VC selling its illiquid, non-public equity stake to another VC through a peer-to-peer transaction. These transactions are called secondaries and might depend on approval from the startup\u2019s board of directors based on the shareholders\u2019 agreement. Additionally, there might not be sufficient buyer VCs willing to pay the price that the seller VCs want to execute the trade at.\nDue to the long-term commitment VCs have to make, they typically spend a significant amount of time on due diligence to ensure that they bet on the right horse and once they do make the investment, they have a strong incentive to add as much value as possible. Not having a short-term exit option also keeps VCs accountable for their investment decisions \u2014 there is a big difference between the mentality of a VC that invests 10 years from now and a trader that makes a 1-year bet.\nFounders & employees have the same options as VCs. Due to shareholders' agreement and other legal reasons, for them to sell their illiquid, non-public equity stakes is even more difficult. So they are fully incentivized for long-term exit-driven success and as the company performs", "doc_id": "6e769cc0-2459-4583-a197-a34e69c83d79", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0a2bb18900e676d3314516c0e01895ffca61083b78f037ef018d2d748298fea3", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 60391, "end": 76027}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "3c68470c-c169-45a0-86fd-99f99d9036eb", "3": "41ea4584-9a07-4eb1-ab5d-c74f64e2e93f"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41ea4584-9a07-4eb1-ab5d-c74f64e2e93f": {"text": "the price that the seller VCs want to execute the trade at.\nDue to the long-term commitment VCs have to make, they typically spend a significant amount of time on due diligence to ensure that they bet on the right horse and once they do make the investment, they have a strong incentive to add as much value as possible. Not having a short-term exit option also keeps VCs accountable for their investment decisions \u2014 there is a big difference between the mentality of a VC that invests 10 years from now and a trader that makes a 1-year bet.\nFounders & employees have the same options as VCs. Due to shareholders' agreement and other legal reasons, for them to sell their illiquid, non-public equity stakes is even more difficult. So they are fully incentivized for long-term exit-driven success and as the company performs better, they can justify paying themselves higher salaries.\nThus, the traditional early-stage investing industry participants, investors and founders, are incentivized to build a long-term viable business and don\u2019t have any early exit opportunities.\nVC Model\nVCs are not managing their own capital \u2014 they invest other people\u2019s money in startups. VCs are merely an agent whose fiduciary duty is to look after the best investment opportunities for their clients, execute on those opportunities and return back the capital after 10 years.\nThe \u201cother people\u201d described above are called limited partners \u2014 they are wealthy individuals, sovereign wealth funds (Saudi, Norway, etc.), pension funds (Yale, BP), endowments/foundations (Gates Foundation) and other capital allocators. These institutions do not have the talent and expertise to form their internal team to directly invest in these deals so end up investing in VCs that specialize in a specific area and have a track record of past successful investments.\n\nInvestor types that allocate capital to VCs\nThe typical agreement between the VC managers and limited partners is that the VC will not return the funds for a minimum of 10 years \u2014 in other words, the fund will have a life of 10 years. The VC spends the first 3\u20134 years making investments and the remaining years harvesting its returns.\nThe conclusion from the VC model is that VCs are not in a rush! Their mandate is to make long-term investments and they do not need to exit an investment in less than at least 5\u20136 years.\nWhy Have An Equity Entity? Why Not Just Have A Longer Token Vesting Period?\nAllocating the tokens to an equity entity enables token protocol-related governance decisions to be made unilaterally in addition to giving more control & legal power to the shareholders.\nIf there is a potential acquirer for the protocol, it would be easier for them to acquire 40% of the tokens and the legal benefits of the equity entity rather than having to collect the tokens from the public or having to negotiate with each investor bilaterally.\n\nWhat Are The Potential Problems With Equity Entity Owning A Large % of Tokens?\nSEC suggests a regulatory framework for digital tokens based on the level of decentralization of the token network. An equity entity owning 30\u201340% of the token network might not pass SEC\u2019s minimum decentralization requirement.\nAnother potential problem could be double taxation. Once the underlying business reaches maturity and decides to distribute tokens as dividends (payment-in-kind) or is acquired by another company \u2014 the investors might need to pay double taxes.\nConclusion\nWe propose that no tokens should be allocated to equity investors and team \u2014 tokens should rather be allocated to the equity entity. Those tokens held by the equity entity shouldn\u2019t be unlocked and distributed to the shareholders until the business reaches a maturity pre-defined by certain business metrics. As the business metrics are reached, the shareholders should be allowed to partially or fully rewarded their pro-rata share of the tokens. This makes the equity entity more \u201cacquirable\u201d for potential acquirers.\nAlternatively, the token vesting period should be extended to 10+ years with pre-defined exceptions of business KPI targets or a potential M&A.\nNone of this is financial or legal advice.

We shall delve into how the value generated within the Yuga Ecosystem is apportioned among the diverse stakeholders within the Yuga Ecosystem (Yuga Labs, $APE, BAYC, MAYC, etc.).\nWe will be covering:\nCapital Structure & Enterprise Value\nIntrinsic Value\nYuga\u2019s Business Model\nDilution\nBAYC Sale | May 2021\nMAYC Sale | Aug 2021\n$APE Launch | Mar 2022\nOtherdeeds Sale | May 2022\nSewer Pass Launch | Jan 2023\nYuga Ecosystem Earnings\nMultiple Stakeholder Problem\nConclusion\n1. CAPITAL STRUCTURE & ENTERPRISE VALUE\nIn a web2 enterprise, the capital structure generally comprises equity and different tiers of debt. The senior debt lenders usually possess a higher collateral security but receive a lower interest rate, whereas the junior debt lenders hold less collateral security yet levy a higher interest rate.\nEnterprise value is like the price tag on a company. It tells us how much the company is worth altogether, including how much money it owes to others (like banks) and how much money it belongs to the owners (like shareholders).\nEnterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt Value\n\nLenders and minority equity shareholders have legal entitlements to the earnings and assets of the enterprise. In contrast, NFT and token owners do not enjoy such protections. Nevertheless, by including tokens and NFTs issued by Web3 companies as part of the overall capital structure, we can enhance the design and structure of value accrual.\nUsing the same logic, Yuga Ecosystem Value is equal to how much the whole Yuga world is worth. It is the sum of how much money belongs to Yuga Labs Equity Entity and the value of all existing NFT collections (BAYC, MAYC, etc.) and tokens ($APE).\nYuga Ecosystem Value = Yuga Labs Equity Value + Value of Yuga NFTs & Tokens\n\n2. INTRINSIC VALUE\nIntrinsic value is how much something will be worth in the future, and we estimate it based on how much money it will make in the future. But because future money is not as valuable as current money, we make the future money a bit smaller, which is called discounting.\nSo, the fundamental value of a company, token or NFT equals its discounted future earnings. Using the same logic, Yuga Ecosystem Value equals its discounted future earnings.\nYuga Ecosystem Value = Discounted Future Earnings\n3. YUGA\u2019S BUSINESS MODEL?\nHow does the Yuga Ecosystem generate revenue? Let\u2019s examine the fundamental Yuga Ecosystem revenue streams.\nYuga has two primary revenue channels:\nNFT & Token Sales \u2192 creating and selling new tokens and NFT collections\nNFT Royalties \u2192 charging a fee for every secondary NFT transaction\n\n4. DARK SIDE OF ISSUING NEW NFTs: DILUTION\nThe creation and sale of new NFT collections, such as BAYC, MAYC, and Otherdeeds, represent a significant source of revenue for the Yuga Ecosystem. Yuga Labs earned $100m from MAYC and $330m from Otherdeeds primary sales, while holding $2bn+ worth of Ape Coin and $40m worth of Otherdeeds on its balance sheet.\nHowever, releasing new NFT collections has a downside: it dilutes the ownership of existing Yuga Ecosystem stakeholders (Yuga Labs, APE, BAYC). For existing stakeholders in the Yuga Ecosystem to benefit from dilution, the value created from issuing and selling a new NFT collection should outweigh the dilution costs.\nThe idea is akin to the concept of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), where the purchasing firm acquires the target company through an exchange of shares. As a result, the shareholders of the purchasing company experience dilution. The success of the acquisition hinges on whether the value created by the target company outweighs the cost of the dilution. If the value generated is greater, the acquisition is deemed successful; otherwise, it is considered a failure.\n5. BAYC SALE | MAY 2021\nYuga Labs created a new group of stakeholders, known as BAYC Holders, when they issued and sold 10K BAYC at $200* per item, earning $2M from the primary sale.\nIt\u2019s important to note that NFTs sold by PFP projects and web3 game studios aren\u2019t just virtual goods, people buy them with the expectation that their value will increase over time.\nThis is why BAYC owners are considered a separate stakeholder class in the Yuga Ecosystem, as the issuer company has a responsibility to these NFT owners.\n\nOver the few months post-sale, the price of BAYC has risen significantly, reaching $66k by the end of August.\nThis means that the market value of BAYC could be as high as $660m, and if we assume a 1:1 conversion between the BAYC market cap and Yuga Labs\u2019 equity entity valuation, then Yuga Labs\u2019 would also be valued at around $660m.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nLet\u2019s analyze the above Machinations diagram:\n10k BAYC were sold by Yuga Labs in exchange for $2M\nBAYC Price rose from $200 to $66K in 4 months\nYuga Labs had generated $2.5M in BAYC royalties by month 4\n6. MAYC SALE | AUG 2021\nLet\u2019s examine the issuance and sale of MAYC. Prior to the release of MAYC, BAYC had a market capitalization of approximately $660 million, and the ecosystem consisted solely of BAYC owners and Yuga Labs which was owned by the four founders.\n\nA total of 20,000 MAYC NFTs were created, with 10,000 sold to the public and 10,000 given to BAYC Holders. This means that Yuga Labs and BAYC each received 50% of the earnings from the issuance of MAYC.\nUnlike other PFP NFT collections that offer no other financial returns than the change in price, BAYC Holders could claim future Yuga NFTs for free. This gave a clear message to BAYC Holders that they have a crucial seat in the Yuga Ecosystem.\n\nYuga Labs successfully sold the 10,000 MAYC NFTs for $10,000 each, earning $10 million. The 10,000 MAYC NFTs given to BAYC Holders were theoretically worth $10 million at the end of the MAYC sale.\nAt the time of MAYC issuance, some concerns were raised about its potential impact. Firstly, there was uncertainty regarding the ability of Yuga Labs to sell all 10k MAYC NFTs. Secondly, the sale of a new collection (MAYC) was feared to dilute value away from BAYC, leading to a decrease in BAYC NFT prices due to increased competition.\nHowever, despite these concerns, the sale of MAYC proved to be a massive success for Yuga Labs, generating $10 million in revenue and paving the way for future NFT offerings.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nLet\u2019s analyze the Machinations Diagram:\n10k MAYC were sold by Yuga Labs in exchange for $100M\nMAYC Price rose from $10K to $58K in 7 months\nYuga Labs had generated $25M in MAYC royalties by month 7\nSeveral weeks prior to the launch of ApeCoin, Yuga\u2019s inaugural token, BAYC was being traded at a staggering $2.2 billion, while MAYC was being traded at $1.1 billion. Yuga\u2019s ability to generate immense new value by introducing new NFT collections had enticed well-funded late-stage crypto venture capitalists.\nYuga had secured a whopping $450 million in seed funding at a valuation of $4.5 billion, spearheaded by a16a, which would be made public in late March, just a few weeks after the launch of ApeCoin.\nIf we were to disregard our 1:1 NFT Market Cap to Equity rule and adopt the seed round valuation, the value accrual structure would appear as follows.\n\n7. $APE LAUNCH | MAR 2022\nThe launch of $APE in March 2022 was a significant event for the Yuga ecosystem, and it was highly anticipated by the NFT community. Yuga Labs, had been gaining traction in the blockchain space with several successful launches.\nAs a result, many people were eagerly waiting for the launch of Apecoin, hoping that it would live up to the high standards set by Yuga Labs. In this section, we will discuss in detail the ApeCoin issuance and its impact on the Yuga ecosystem.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nThe initial token allocation was designed to allocate 47% of tokens to the ecosystem, 15% to Yuga Labs, 1% to charity, 8% to founders, 14% to VCs, and 15% to BAYC & MAYC holders.\nOur definition of Yuga Ecosystem Stakeholders (Yuga Labs, BAYC, MAYC, VCs) was allocated a cumulative 52% of tokens. Let\u2019s look at the distribution within that 52%:\n\nWhile the aforementioned numbers provide some insight, they do not provide the complete picture. It is important to note that the VCs and Founders of Yuga Labs also have a vested interest in Yuga Labs, which means they are indirectly receiving more tokens than the figures stated earlier. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the numbers further to get a more accurate distribution of tokens.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that no employees or advisors have any ownership in Yuga Labs, and we\u2019re also excluding the potential equity dilution from the Larva Labs (CryptoPunks IP) acquisition. Based on the $450M seed round, it appears that Yuga Labs Founders own 89% of the company, while Yuga Labs VCs own the remaining 11%. When we tally up the numbers, this translates to a token allocation of 41% for Yuga Labs Founders and 30% for Yuga Labs VCs.\n\nThe allocation of $APE Coin differed significantly from that of MAYC. While the distribution of 20k MAYC was divided equally between Yuga Labs and BAYC holders, the allocation of $APE Coin favored Yuga Labs shareholders over BAYC and MAYC holders.\nOur calculations indicate that Yuga Labs and its shareholders received 71% of the allocation, while BAYC/MAYC holders received only 29%. This equates to a 2.4:1 ratio, which is higher than the", "doc_id": "41ea4584-9a07-4eb1-ab5d-c74f64e2e93f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a95ce6d778534406b7ad9e36b570826da6aa20d6c17ce651e11460b8171533ff", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 75989, "end": 90130}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "6e769cc0-2459-4583-a197-a34e69c83d79", "3": "e24ce89b-867b-4c67-8a5a-ee394ee46c57"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e24ce89b-867b-4c67-8a5a-ee394ee46c57": {"text": "on the $450M seed round, it appears that Yuga Labs Founders own 89% of the company, while Yuga Labs VCs own the remaining 11%. When we tally up the numbers, this translates to a token allocation of 41% for Yuga Labs Founders and 30% for Yuga Labs VCs.\n\nThe allocation of $APE Coin differed significantly from that of MAYC. While the distribution of 20k MAYC was divided equally between Yuga Labs and BAYC holders, the allocation of $APE Coin favored Yuga Labs shareholders over BAYC and MAYC holders.\nOur calculations indicate that Yuga Labs and its shareholders received 71% of the allocation, while BAYC/MAYC holders received only 29%. This equates to a 2.4:1 ratio, which is higher than the 1:1 ratio for MAYC allocation. As a result, a16z and Yuga Founders received a greater $APE Coin allocation at the expense of BAYC and MAYC holders.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the tokens assigned to BAYC and MAYC holders were immediately accessible, while those assigned to Yuga Labs, VCs, and Founders have a 4-year vesting period.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s important to consider that if the token allocation had been distributed evenly between Yuga Labs shareholders and BAYC/MAYC owners, BAYC/MAYC owners would have had the option to claim their allotted tokens gradually over a four-year vesting period.\n8. OTHERDEEDS SALE | MAY 2022\n\nIn the days leading up to the Otherdeeds sale, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and $APE coin were all trading at their all-time highs.\nBAYC boasted a staggering ~$4 billion market cap, MAYC had reached ~$2 billion, and $APE coin had a market cap of $6.5 billion. Yuga Labs had managed to turn 10,000 utility-less monkey JPEGs into a multi-billion-dollar empire in less than two years!\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the NFT collection market cap is calculated based on the floor price multiplied by the circulating supply, so the actual valuation may have been much lower if someone wanted to purchase all circulating Yuga Ecosystem assets in one transaction.\n\nOut of the 100k Otherdeeds issued in total; 55k were sold publicly, 10k given to BAYC, 20k given to MAYC, 15k reserved by Yuga Labs.\nIn total; 70% of Otherdeeds were allocated to Yuga Labs. We are seeing another case where Yuga Labs got overallocated at the expense of NFT & $APE token Holders. Additionally; MAYC Holders got overallocated at the expense of BAYC Holders. And $APE holders didn\u2019t get any Otherdeeds allocation.\nOf the 100,000 Otherdeeds issued, 55,000 were sold publicly, 10,000 were given to BAYC, 20,000 were given to MAYC, and 15,000 were reserved by Yuga Labs. In total, 70% of the Otherdeeds were allocated to Yuga Labs.\nWe are witnessing another instance where Yuga Labs received a relatively excessive allocation at the expense of BAYC/MAYC NFT and $APE token holders. Additionally, MAYC holders were overallocated at the expense of BAYC holders, and $APE holders did not receive any Otherdeeds allocation.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nLet\u2019s analyze the Machinations Diagram:\nYuga Labs sold 55k Otherdeeds NFTs for $310M. $310M worth of purchasing power was utilized to acquire Otherdeeds NFTs but Yuga Labs pledged not to touch the $APE proceeds for 1 year. As a result, the current value of Yuga\u2019s $APE proceeds from the Otherdeeds sale is roughly $80M.\nOtherdeeds Price fell from $31k to $2k in 7 months\nYuga Labs had generated $56M in Otherdeeds royalties by month 7\nAlthough we previously stated that APE holders did not receive any allocation of Otherdeeds, it is important to note that the primary sale occurred using $APE. However, using APE as the medium of exchange for buying Otherdeeds assets in the auction does not necessarily result in the accrual of value to $APE or make it a sustainable sink.\nValue can only accrue to $APE permanently if the 16M $APE sent by Otherdeeds purchasers was deposited into $APE DAO\u2019s treasury wallet. If that were the case, the excess APE held in the treasury would be subject to collective voting by the APE governance on how to utilize it, as it would remain on APE DAO\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nLooking at the hypothetical Machinations diagram, we can observe a few events taking place. Every month, 5 million APE tokens are emitted into circulation via pre-scheduled token unlocks and staking rewards. Additionally, we can see that 1,000 APE tokens are transferred from circulation back into the $APE treasury every month through the sale of Sewer Pass IAPs in Yuga\u2019s mobile game (which we will discuss shortly).\nThe value of $APE theoretically increases as more tokens accumulate in the treasury. However, if the tokens are not accumulated in the treasury and are instead staked, this only delays the inevitable \u2014 Yuga Labs selling their own token allocation.\n\nYuga Labs Machinations model created by Vader Research\nRegarding the Otherdeeds sale, it is important to note that the $APE payments made by purchasers went directly to Yuga Labs\u2019 wallet, rather than the APE DAO\u2019s treasury. This means that Yuga Labs has full control over those tokens and can sell them at any time, distributing the proceeds to its shareholders. However, Yuga Labs did make a promise not to sell the $APE tokens earned from the Otherdeeds sale for a period of one year.\nEssentially, Yuga Labs is quasi-staking $APE for one year, but it is likely that they will sell some portion of it at the end of the year. This results in a one-year sink for the $APE tokens, but in reality, the tokens earned from the Otherdeeds sale are still under Yuga Labs\u2019 control.\nIn this hypothetical Machinations diagram, we demonstrate that in a scenario where Yuga Labs regularly sells 5 million $APE every month, the proceeds earned from Otherside sale only serve to slow down the sell pressure on $APE temporarily.\n9. SEWER PASS LAUNCH | JAN 2023\nPrior to the launch of Sewer Pass, the value of Yuga\u2019s assets had declined alongside the broader cryptocurrency market. Specifically, the Yuga Ecosystem Value fell from $17 billion in May 2022 to $3.8 billion in January 2023.\n\nThe release of Sewer Pass NFTs was accompanied by a hypercasual game called Dookie Dash. We had previously conducted a thorough analysis of the gamified drop mechanism on Twitter.\nLet\u2019s now examine the structure of the Sewer Pass issuance\n\nA total of 26,500 Sewer Passes were issued, and they were distributed among BAYC and MAYC owners. We will not delve into the specifics of the allocation between the two groups and will assume an even distribution. The Sewer Passes supposedly serve as a gateway to a new Yuga NFT collection.\nYuga Labs opted to generously reward the entire collection to BAYC and MAYC holders, whereas they had excluded themselves from this issuance. However, APE Coin and Otherdeeds holders did not receive any rewards.\nDookie Dash in-game microtransactions can be purchased using $APE currency, and the proceeds from these transactions are deposited directly into the $APE DAO\u2019s Treasury. Nonetheless, the total earnings from these microtransactions are trivial when compared to the value of Sewer Pass NFTs.\nHere\u2019s the current Yuga Ecosystem capital structure as of March 2023\n\n10. YUGA ECOSYSTEM EARNINGS\nThe table displays the revenue generated by Yuga Labs, BAYC, and MAYC from the issuance and sale of Yuga NFTs and tokens. While BAYC and MAYC holders appear to have earned a greater sum of $1.3 billion and $572 million, respectively, Yuga Labs\u2019 earnings of $412 million exclude the tokens and NFTs held in their reserves. It is noteworthy that Yuga Labs holds $2 billion worth of $APE Coin in their reserves.\n\nRoyalties have emerged as a significant source of revenue for NFT projects, although their viability has been challenged by the ongoing NFT marketplace wars.\nYuga Labs, levies a 2.5% charge for BAYC and MAYC, while they charge 5% for Otherdeeds and Sewer Passes. Notably, all royalties earned are exclusively channeled to Yuga Labs, with no distribution to other stakeholders in the Yuga Ecosystem. As a result, Yuga Labs has amassed a cumulative revenue of $182 million from royalties.\n\nRoyalties have yielded substantially lower earnings in comparison to primary sales. As we have previously contended, primary sales are a superior mechanism for monetizing intellectual property. Nonetheless, royalties can serve as a supplementary revenue stream, offering an additional means of income.\n11. MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER PROBLEM\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that arise when dealing with multiple stakeholders is MISALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS. Due to the absence of legal or predetermined smart contract decisions regarding who is entitled to what, each stakeholder may strive to maximize their short-term earnings. At some point, there will likely be an internal conflict between multiple stakeholders as each one lobbies to accrue value to their assets.\nTo prevent this, Yuga Labs must be responsible for managing multiple stakeholders in a relatively fair manner when structuring new issuances and creating new earning channels. A well-designed structure should aim to minimize misalignment of interests and maximize collaboration across all stakeholders.\nFood for thought:\nSuppose Yuga were to launch a new collection tomorrow. How would the company distribute this collection among its stakeholders?\nIf Sewer Pass holders don\u2019t receive any airdrops, what value or utility does a Sewer Pass have? Why would anyone continue to hold onto their Sewer Pass? Why wouldn\u2019t they sell it? The same question applies to Otherdeeds.\nWhat percentage of gaming/metaverse earnings will be shared among Yuga stakeholders? Will BAYC/MAYC holders not receive any stake from gaming earnings?\nIf gaming earnings are only distributed between $APE and Otherdeeds holders, what will be the split? Will it be 50/50? 80/20? Will the split be based on recent market prices or primary sale prices?\nLet\u2019s consider this from the perspective of a retail investor. If one were to invest in the Yuga Ecosystem, which asset should he buy?\nThis question is crucial because each asset provides exposure to different channels of earnings within the Yuga Ecosystem. It would be highly disappointing for an investor if Yuga were to do very well in the future, but the asset they had purchased underperformed compared to other Yuga assets.\nThere is a compelling value proposition for buying BAYC and MAYC. By owning these assets, investors receive a certain percentage of every new Yuga NFT or token issuance. Even though Yuga may sometimes allocate fewer rewards to BAYC and MAYC holders, they still receive a certain percentage from the issuance.\nIf you believe that Yuga\u2019s future NFT and token collections will be valuable, then BAYC or MAYC is the asset to purchase. However, you won\u2019t get exposure to Yuga royalties. The minimum amount of capital required to make such a purchase is relatively high, as the floor prices for BAYC and MAYC trade at $110k+ and $20k+ respectively.\n\n$APE coin, on the other hand, has yet to provide a clear value proposition. $APE currently offers vague and shallow \u201cutilities,\u201d none of which explain how Yuga Ecosystem earnings can accrue to $APE. While being used to purchase Otherdeeds provided temporary value to the token, it just delays the inevitable. Once $APE tokenholders realize that the value created from the Yuga Ecosystem doesn\u2019t accrue to $APE, they will have no reason not to sell it.\nPaying for in-game microtransactions with $APE is a clearer utility (assuming earnings go to $APE DAO\u2019s treasury). We will likely see more $APE utility through Yuga\u2019s gaming/metaverse initiatives. However, Yuga has yet to announce the utilities of existing assets. Delaying this announcement is actually a smart move on their part as it results in even more speculation and anticipation among asset holders.\nThat being said, there is a risk of upsetting asset owners by failing to deliver on promises. Even if Yuga delivers a great IP/game/metaverse, if BAYC holders or Yuga Labs gain relatively more from it than $APE or Otherdeed holders, then those holders will be upset.\n12. CONCLUSION\nValue accrual structuring is a challenging subject in the world of web3. Each set of NFTs or tokens that a project issue becomes a liability on the project\u2019s web3 capital structure. To ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and working together effectively, it\u2019s essential for projects to have a well-designed value accrual structure.\nIf you\u2019re an investor, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough due diligence to fully understand the earnings and value channels you\u2019ll be exposed to. It can be incredibly disappointing to be right about the project and team you\u2019re investing in, only to realize later that you\u2019ve made a mistake in your choice of asset.\nIn short, a well-structured value accrual model is crucial for the success of web3 projects, and investors should take the time to fully understand the assets they\u2019re investing in to avoid disappointment down the line.\nNOTES\nYuga Labs Ecosystem encompasses a range of assets, including Yuga Labs Equity Entity, BAYC, MAYC, Otherside, $APE Coin, Sewer Passes, and Future NFT Collections & Tokens Issued by Yuga Labs. For the purposes of simplicity, we have omitted BAKC and Larva Labs IPs (CryptoPunks, Meebits) that were acquired by Yuga Labs.\nOur calculation of the NFT market cap is based on the end-of-month NFT floor price or monthly average sales price multiplied by the circulating NFT supply. It should be noted, however, that if an acquirer were to purchase all NFTs in a given collection simultaneously, the actual figure would likely be lower than the estimated market cap.\nRegarding the $310M generated from the Otherdeeds sale, it is worth noting that the payment was made in $APE Coin and $APE was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC holders several weeks prior to the sale. As a result, some argue that the actual figure should be lower than $310M. However, BAYC and MAYC holders were given the option to exchange $APE for USD, and $APE was trading", "doc_id": "e24ce89b-867b-4c67-8a5a-ee394ee46c57", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "76e83750f26bb51409312eed7e5fcd567e5983df51cf8843605c8c6ffae5b25f", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 90236, "end": 104304}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "41ea4584-9a07-4eb1-ab5d-c74f64e2e93f", "3": "12a3af82-4976-4f58-b60d-4fc755bd00d0"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12a3af82-4976-4f58-b60d-4fc755bd00d0": {"text": "Meebits) that were acquired by Yuga Labs.\nOur calculation of the NFT market cap is based on the end-of-month NFT floor price or monthly average sales price multiplied by the circulating NFT supply.

However, BAYC and MAYC holders were given the option to exchange $APE for USD, and $APE was trading at a market cap of $10bn+. While it is true that if all BAYC and MAYC holders sold $APE simultaneously, the price of $APE would have fallen, it does not negate the fact that $310M worth of purchasing power was used in the primary Otherdeeds sale.\nApplying the same logic as in above, we estimate that the $APE tokens held as reserves in Yuga Labs\u2019 balance sheet are likely less than $2BN. If Yuga Labs were to sell such a large volume, it would significantly impact the markets. A more appropriate methodology may be to apply a 10\u201320% discount on the NFT market cap and a 30\u201340% discount on the tokens held in reserves.\nNone of this is financial or legal advice.

Players are having so much fun that they are willing to spend money on pay-to-progress or cosmetic premium items (stronger weapon, extra life, skipping waiting time, premium skins, gatchas) just like in F2P games.\nFor simplicity, let\u2019s assume that none of these premium items are NFTs or tokens.\nWhat monetization options do you have?\nOption 1: Charge One-Off Purchases in Fiat/Token/NFT\nIf you charge in token/NFT, you would introduce a sink for that asset. If you charge in fiat; you can always use the fiat to spend more on traditional user acquisition or you can buy back the token/NFT. We talk about the implications of charging in fiat vs token in Token Value Accrual.\n\nAbove is an example of a player spending $60 on IAPs over a 3-month period. This is the traditional F2P monetization method. The developer generates $60 and owes nothing to the player other than providing consumable gaming content.\nOption 2: Battle Pass / Subscriptions\nAs a proud Fortnite battle pass subscriber, I\u2019ve managed to unlock the Darth Vader skin by passing several quests in a given season.\n\nIn this example, the player still spends $60 on premium items mbut via the battle pass subscription rather than purchasing one-off. Compared to one-offs, battle passes offer a cost-effective, gamified way to acquire items for players and a more predictable, recurring revenue channel for game developers. Check out Javier Barnes\u2019 great article on F2P Battle Passes to learn more about them.\nOption 3: Staking\nStaking used to have a technical utility as explained in Cobie\u2019s piece. Staking in Web3 gaming is about bribing holders so they don\u2019t sell their tokens/NFTs.\nIn our example, an NFT holder gets access to premium items for free by not selling the NFT. At first glance, staking seems similar to other options. The player would still need to spend money to get those items. But digging deeper, you realize that staking is not a revenue channel, it is a loan incurred by the game developer.\nHow?\nLet\u2019s check the below example\n\nIn this example, the player spends $60 upfront to purchase an NFT from the game developer. The player stakes the NFT for a 3-month period, receives premium items for free and then sells the NFT for $40. IAPs essentially cost the player only $20!\nSince NFTs are tradable, the player can sell the NFT once he decides he doesn\u2019t want to consume new premium items. The subsequent player has the opportunity to purchase the NFT from the secondary market at $40 (vs $60 from the developer).\nWe assume that NFTs in this example have an infinite supply and can be minted from the developer at a fixed price of $60.\nThe developer generates $60 from the initial players in all 3 monetization methods. The developer can generate $120 from 2 players if the monetization method is one-offs or battle passes. However, the developer can generate only $60 (+$2 optional royalties) from 2 players in the staking method.\nStaking is a LOAN not REVENUE\nHybrid Battle Pass NFTs\nA potential solution is a hybrid between a traditional battle pass and an NFT. The Hybrid Battle Pass NFT would have a temporary lifespan of 3 months and would give access to certain benefits (premium items, raffles, tournaments, etc.).\nThe NFT would be tradable during the 3-month period but would be automatically burnt at the end of 3 months. Speculative activity and price volatility would be relatively limited as the NFT would have minimal value accrual features.\nFinal Words\nWhy give out premium items for less than what they are worth? Why leave money off the table in the name of a \u201ccommunity-driven economy\u201d when in reality you are building an unsustainable economy and an unprofitable business that will cease to exist as it won\u2019t be able to self-finance itself?\nExcess economic rent should not accrue to players unless they are adding value, it should accrue to the developer who can reinvest proceeds into making the game better.\nNow this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all staking is bad. We kept assumptions extremely basic here to focus on key concepts but there are a few staking design that can actually add more net value than battle passes.\nKeep this in mind; if you exercise staking to give away premium items that could have been sold via battle passes, you will cannibalize recurring revenue from battle passes.\nAnother question is whether assets bought via IAPs or Battle Passes should be tradable items (token/NFT) or not. But that is a topic for another article.\nNone of this is financial or legal advice.

Token economics refers to the distribution, value accrual mechanism, emission schedule, and sinks associated with a token. A well-designed token economy helps good projects compound their growth by enabling a flywheel to bootstrap usage. If successful, the value generated by the project can be passed on to token holders.\nWhile good token economics can complement good products, success really boils down to the product\u2019s strength. Unsurprisingly, poorly designed token economies don\u2019t help good projects, as they often serve as an added point of friction. Poor token economics with a poor product spells doomsday.\nIn the case of a good project with bad token economics, the market is bound to take advantage of the situation. GCR is a well-known trader from the last cycle, noted for topping the FTX PNL leaderboard and making several accurate market predictions. Towards the end of the last cycle, GCR was focused on finding coins with massive upcoming unlocks and taking short positions on them to profit when investors sold their unlocked tokens.\n\nThe increasing focus on token economics and, more specifically, token unlocks has been attributed to changes in token distributions. Despite the negative connotations, ICOs provided a level playing field where most participants invested in a project at the same cost. However, in the past couple of years, the environment has shifted to one where professional investors have a massive edge \u2013 from increased allocations to a significantly lower cost basis versus retail investors. Both market cycles had \u201cfair\u201d and VC-dominant token distributions, but the latter seems more pronounced nowadays.\nUnderstanding the Basics\nThe gold standard of a successful project is one with a useful, viable product and well-designed token economics. The key to achieving the latter is threading the token into the product to create a strong flywheel that increases the usage of said product. Many projects introduce a token to enrich founders and investors. The token doesn\u2019t accrue value and often provides trivial utility. Though having a well-designed token economy is important, it doesn\u2019t improve a sub-optimal product.\nA fair distribution, healthy float level/emission schedule, and utility/value accrual can make for a good token design. Juggling the goals of rapid growth fueled by token incentives and a healthy token economy is a balancing act mastered by only a few projects.\nWhen determining a healthy balance, one metric we like to look at is emission-adjusted revenue. GMX has 2x revenue compared to token emissions. The ratio of revenue/token emissions is consistently trending higher, which suggests that the user base is active, sticky, and less likely to negatively impact the protocol once incentives run out. 30% of the fees from swaps and leveraged trading are distributed to GMX stakers. Having a healthy token distribution adds another point to the tally.\n\nAlthough a useful metric, emission-adjusted revenue doesn\u2019t reveal the full picture. Uniswap has a great product. There are no token emissions and it is one of the highest revenue-generating projects. Over 60% of the supply has been distributed to the community. But the token doesn\u2019t accrue any value. The ability to participate in the governance process is its sole use case, which obviously leaves much to be desired. But this is proof that a subpar token design doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt a strong product, but it doesn\u2019t help it either.\nSUSHI has arguably better token economics than UNI. It has a fair distribution, high float, and value accrual for stakers/holders. In terms of token economics, SUSHI checks all the boxes. The revenue/token emission ratio is quite high, second only to Uniswap, with revenue being 7.6x the dollar value of emissions. Yet, the deteriorating fundamentals have resulted in the ratio trending downwards. The case of SUSHI supports our claim that good token economics cannot make up for the lack of a good, differentiated product.\nComplexity associated with token designs has been steadily increasing. Projects have resorted to convoluted tactics to obfuscate the real token and reward distribution. This only works well until people find out, making it difficult to rebuild trust after.\nA great example of this is the \u201ccommunity\u201d centric launch of LooksRare. The documentation suggests that 75% of the total token supply is reserved for the community, which has been further broken down into airdrop (12%), staking rewards (18.9%), and volume rewards (44.1%).\n\nVolume rewards refers to the LOOKS tokens distributed to traders on the platform. Every buyer and seller on the platform is compensated with additional tokens (except for private NFT trades). Staking rewards refers to the LOOKS tokens + trading fees collected (in WETH) distributed to stakers.\nStakers are categorized as active stakers and passive stakers (strategic investors, team, and treasury tokens). Active stakers receive both additional LOOKS tokens as well as trading fees. Passive stakers only receive trading fees while their tokens are locked.\nLet\u2019s assume that all the tokens released from volume rewards + staking rewards were immediately staked. Then, the share of trading fee rewards going to the strategic investors would be [(33M/# of staked tokens)*volume for that day]. Running this formula from Jan. 10, 2022 to Jul. 15, 2022, we get $38.04M. Even though the strategic sale investors did not benefit by receiving additional LOOKS, they did pocket one-third of the current market cap from passive staking. The team also earned over 20,151 WETH (~$31.5M at the current market price) to date.\n\nAlthough the reward distribution was mentioned in the project\u2019s documentation, few people actually go through the documentation. As a result, when the community eventually found out about this, it didn\u2019t bode well for LOOKS. The estimate provided on Twitter wasn\u2019t accurate, as the actual amount was half of what was stated. But the amount mattered much less than the action itself.\nAlso, the distribution shown in the project\u2019s documentation doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Once the tokens for investors, the treasury, and team members start unlocking, they also become eligible for rewards in LOOKS.\n\nThe team, treasury, and investors receive 5.2%, 6.9%, and 12% more tokens \u2013 if kept staked until the last day of token emissions \u2013 than what is purported in the documentation. Though it isn\u2019t a massive change, it\u2019s non-negligible. The project did not deceive anyone, as all of this information is public, but the convoluted token design makes it difficult for the average holder to understand the true distribution.\nAnother such case was observed with the recent launch of Aptos. Details regarding the token distribution were made available moments before the listing. At face value, the distribution seems fair, with over 50% of the initial supply allocated to the community and 23.4M APT tokens airdropped to users.\n\nIf you scroll down just a bit, you\u2019ll see the community", "doc_id": "12a3af82-4976-4f58-b60d-4fc755bd00d0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "10455cefe4f32623998e0789d0f2557b16b0097baa4bf7c2a1fa7daba591537f", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 104258, "end": 119200}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "e24ce89b-867b-4c67-8a5a-ee394ee46c57", "3": "081e9208-3e27-4189-90b8-36e2eda94348"}, "__type__": "1"}, "081e9208-3e27-4189-90b8-36e2eda94348": {"text": "treasury, and investors receive 5.2%, 6.9%, and 12% more tokens \u2013 if kept staked until the last day of token emissions \u2013 than what is purported in the documentation.

Details regarding the token distribution were made available moments before the listing. At face value, the distribution seems fair, with over 50% of the initial supply allocated to the community and 23.4M APT tokens airdropped to users.\n\nIf you scroll down just a bit, you\u2019ll see the community allocation is held by the Aptos Foundation (410,217,359.767M) and Aptos Labs (100,000,000M). The article reads, \u201cThis pool of tokens is designated for ecosystem-related items, such as grants, incentives, and other community growth initiatives. These tokens are just held by Aptos and will be distributed over several years.\u201d Although this is standard, it is easy to overlook the staking rewards from token inflation.\nIrrespective of locked or unlocked tokens, they can still be staked to earn the staking rewards, which are unlocked by default. Suppose the percentage of staked supply remains constant (currently 82%). In that case, we can come up with estimates of supply expansion using the rate of inflation (7% annually, to be reduced by 1.5% until a terminal rate of 3.5% is reached).\n\nThe community makes up only 2.85% of the staked supply, whereas the other stakeholders make up over 97%. Given that the staking rewards are distributed pro rata, the \u201ccommunity\u201d will receive 23.4M APT, which dwarfs in comparison to the 798M+ APT tokens going to stakeholders.\nEven though 510M APT tokens are allocated to the community, it is unclear what will happen to the staking rewards earned while they are in Aptos\u2019 custody. If the custodians keep the staking rewards, the true distribution will look significantly different over time as the share of tokens to the community gets constantly diluted. The share of staked tokens weighs on governance voting. Given that Aptos makes up the majority, governance rights become a facade. Although this has not led to any major changes in the price, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where this continues to be the case.\nRisk/Reward Profile Associated With Staking\nNumerous projects offer additional tokens as a reward for staking (disregarding validator staking) their native token. Imagine this: I stake $100 worth of XYZ tokens with a project that offers an APY of 100%. I get to double my money in a year just by clicking a button. How wonderful, right? Well, not quite.\nOften, the staking yield is provided in the form of additional XYZ tokens. If the price of XYZ was $1 when I initially staked, I would get 100 XYZ. After a year, I would have 200 XYZ from the yield I received. But, this comes with a faulty assumption that the token price will remain the same. Given how volatile the crypto markets are, it is quite feasible that the price of XYZ becomes $0.3, in which case my 200 XYZ would now be worth less than my initial dollar value of the investment. A failure in understanding price\u2019s impact on cumulative yield was the primary reason market participants got rinsed during DeFi summer.\nThe underlying liquidity for the token matters a lot too. Let\u2019s assume that initially, there are only 100k XYZ tokens. In the unlikely scenario that my XYZ tokens trade at $1 a year after I staked, the liquidity for the tokens would more often than not remain the same. If the liquidity pool has $100k of USDT (or equivalent), then even if an individual holds the entire supply, they can only cash out $100k. The price of the token would be decimated. Fast-forward a year. Assuming 100% of the initial supply was staked, the circulating supply would then become 200k XYZ after a year. However, the exit dynamics remain similar. The first few sellers might be able to realize their paper profits, effectively creating a race to the exits.\nLastly, one should consider the R/R of staking vs. merely holding. Most projects, if not all, have some lock-up period associated with their staking mechanism. Keeping everything the same as in the above example, let\u2019s assume that the lock-up period is one week. User A has staked their tokens and user B has not. Unfavorable news breaks out, resulting in the price of XYZ falling by 60%. User B was quick to act and could sell at a slight loss. User A had their tokens stuck in the staking module and could not sell. By the time they received their tokens, the price had fallen 80%, and even though they held double the number of tokens, the net dollar value of the investment was significantly less.\nTL;DR: There is no free lunch. Every promise of free money (yield) comes with risk. Often, the risk far outweighs the potential reward.\nFully Diluted Valuations Matter\nIt is a common theme among crypto participants that fully diluted valuations are irrelevant, and market capitalization is the only metric that matters. Proponents claim that since the tokens are not in circulation, they don\u2019t impact the price. The other side believes that if the market cap is the current size of the public demand, then low-float projects need to increase the public demand for their token by several orders of magnitude to maintain the same price. Therefore, if market cap is a demand metric, then FDV is a supply metric. The ratio of FDV/MC serves as the multiple by which the supply is set to expand.\nSolana-based protocols/applications are characterized by a low-float/high FDV, serving as our rationale for picking these particular tokens.\n\nSeveral projects employ a \u201clow market cap, high FDV\u201d approach to keep the price of tokens elevated. The playbook for these projects is as follows:\nImagine a project called XYZANA raises $10M from investors at a valuation of $200M. The price per token they receive is $0.05, with a 6-month-long cliff period followed by an unlock over 12 months (team tokens have the same schedule).\nThe initial circulating supply is 1% (airdrop, liquidity, rewards, etc.), and there is $20M of public demand (MC). The FDV becomes $2B, the price is $0.5, and investors are up 10x.\nThe project begins to gain attention, which translates to another $180M of demand on the secondary market, such that FDV = $20B, the price is $5, and investors are up 100x.\nFast-forward to 6 months after launch, when the investor and team tokens begin to unlock. In just the next 12 months, the supply will increase by 100x. Investors will sell relentlessly even after an 80% drop, as they are still up 20x. At the same price, the team tokens are worth $1.2B (assuming 30% allocation), and they are happy to pocket a third of it for 18 months of \u201cwork.\u201d\nThe summary table serves as strong evidence against those who suggest a high FDV is irrelevant. Tokens launched on Solana under the \u201clow market cap, high FDV\u201d playbook supported by many are the best example of this.\nFIDA (Bonfida) and GMT (STEPN) were already down 97.9/90.5% while only having 10/6.03% of the supply in circulation. The price per token in the private sale was $0.1 (FIDA) and $0.005 (GMT), which means that the investors will still be selling at a profit (3.8x for FIDA and 75x for GMT).\nThis model fails to consider that a higher token price, and thus FDV, in the early stages results in more severe future dilution in USD terms.\n\nWe compared the relative performance of low-float tokens (from the table) with a basket of analogous high-float tokens. We used price action for each asset before the FTX saga to best demonstrate our point while disregarding exogenous factors. Each asset within the basket received equal weight. It\u2019s evident from the chart above that the float does make a difference. While high-float tokens were beaten down over 2022 because of market conditions, they found some respite as the market found temporary footing. However, low-float tokens were not able to move past their massive supply overhang, reflected in the continuous downtrend with no relief.\nMarket Dynamics That Affect an Unlock\nSolana ecosystem tokens were notorious for having low floats. But the low market cap, high FDV curse is prevalent even outside this ecosystem. The effects are not always the same, however. Sometimes tokens experience hefty corrections, and other times tokens are unaffected by the unlock. So how do we decipher which factors play a key role in determining the implications of a token unlock? In this section, we evaluate a few factors that skew the odds of what\u2019s going to happen.\nLarge Token Unlocks\nUndoubtedly, the percentage of supply getting unlocked is a crucial determinant of its impact on the price. When the supply expands in multiples, it becomes challenging to offset its ill effects.\nExhibit A:\n\nOn Oct. 15, 2021, FLOW opened the day at $17.68. By close, it traded at a low of $9.2 (Kraken) and ~$6.1 (CoinList). A maximum of $5.1B in selling pressure could\u2019ve come through as 300M FLOW (6x the circulating supply) tokens were unlocked. The investor allocation accounted for ~75% of the unlocked amount, the team for ~12%, the ecosystem fund for ~2%, and inflation for ~12% (over seven months).\nOf course, the price dropped in response to the selling. But, investors were still up over 100x and could have continued selling in profit despite a 48% correction.\nExhibit B:\n\nRadix DLT came up with a unique token unlock strategy. For every $0.02 price increase, 5% of the supply would unlock. This would continue until $0.43 was reached, at which point 100% of the supply would be unlocked. The community, over time, grew unhappy with this mechanism. The team responded by unlocking the rest of the supply (excluding the stablecoin reserve) at once.\nBefore the unlock on Sep. 15, 2021, the circulating supply was ~1.89B, which was then bumped to 9.6B (5x), resulting in a flash crash of over 90%. By the daily close, the price rebounded and was up 800% from the low. EXRD made a new ATH of $0.687 (up 55x from the low).\nLiquidity for Illiquid Tokens\nIn the above examples, the projects did not attempt to create additional liquidity, which would have resulted in a muted impact. There are two sides to generating liquidity:\nA sneaky tactic of creating positive narratives to generate temporary demand just before an unlock.\nThe prevalence of OTC markets, allowing investors to take profit without affecting the market price. This simultaneously facilitates a concentration of tokens in the hands of investors with higher conviction.\nExhibit C:\n\nOasis Network announced a $160M ecosystem fund two days before the supply was set to increase by 133% (1.471B ROSE). Investors accounted for ~51.6%, core contributors for ~20.3%, community and ecosystem for ~27.6%, and strategic partners/reserves for ~0.84%.\nSeveral projects announced an ecosystem fund during that period, resulting in the price appreciation of their tokens. Some projects took advantage of the narrative to create \u201cexit liquidity\u201d for potential sellers to reduce the price impact. In the case of Oasis, unsurprisingly, the price more than doubled leading into the unlock, only to halve in the following days.\nExhibit D:\n\nNym used the same playbook as Oasis, and announced a $300M ecosystem fund a day before the unlock. Out of the 80.75M NYM getting unlocked, investors made up ~60.3% and the team ~30.9%, with the rest going to testnet rewards and mix-mining. As the supply expanded by 2.3x, not only was the \u201cannouncement pump\u201d outdone, but the price fell by over 70% in 9 days.\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to factually pinpoint whether the moves by Oasis and Nym were intentional to generate liquidity, the timing sure does give rise to suspicion. So this is something investors should be wary of when they see positive announcements coinciding with upcoming token unlocks.\nExhibit E:\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen the negative implications of token unlocks.\nSolana\u2019s token allocation was heavily skewed towards investors and team members, such that only 1.6% of the supply was for the community. The sale price per token ranged from $0.04 (for seed investors) to $0.25 (for strategic investors). It wouldn\u2019t be too outlandish to expect heavy profit-taking, especially when the supply would increase by over 7x with investors up anywhere from 10-60x.\nMuch to everyone\u2019s dismay, SOL rallied over 25,000% after (from ATL to ATH), and proceeded to outperform pretty much the entire market. The price action defied all logic, but how did this happen? Well, through OTC markets.\nA chart shows a project\u2019s price history on the secondary market, but it doesn\u2019t account for OTC markets. OTC markets facilitate the trading of tokens through a dealer network, generally without affecting the secondary market (at least in the short term). SAFTs for Solana were being sold OTC anywhere from a 60-80% discount before the unlock. The fear was bought up by investors with higher conviction, resulting in their cost basis being 2-4x. There was a supply-side shock as less than 2% of tokens (community allocation) were actually in circulation. As price entered its \u201cup-only\u201d regime, the reflexivity kicked in, which paved the way for a ridiculous parabolic advance.\nControlling the majority of an asset\u2019s supply is the closest it gets to having a cheat code in financial markets. As these entities made up half the price equation, supply coming into secondary markets was limited.\nPerpetual Futures\nThe prevalence of perpetual futures for altcoins allows: (i) private investors to hedge their locked tokens, (ii) secondary buyers to hedge exposure before an unlock, and (iii) traders to short in anticipation of a dump.\nExhibit F:\n\nThe launch of Internet Computer Protocol was one of the most memorable launches of the last cycle. Perpetual futures for ICP were launched five days before spot trading began across all major exchanges. ICP rallied over 400% coming into the launch, which was synonymous with the network\u2019s genesis, after which", "doc_id": "081e9208-3e27-4189-90b8-36e2eda94348", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "44352003986f7760e7ddce0338cdfa18ae80005c8852d0ed08ade59277f24eb7", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 119184, "end": 133306}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "12a3af82-4976-4f58-b60d-4fc755bd00d0", "3": "505b0c85-f4b6-4b21-855e-df82763bea9f"}, "__type__": "1"}, "505b0c85-f4b6-4b21-855e-df82763bea9f": {"text": "of an asset\u2019s supply is the closest it gets to having a cheat code in financial markets. As these entities made up half the price equation, supply coming into secondary markets was limited.\nPerpetual Futures\nThe prevalence of perpetual futures for altcoins allows: (i) private investors to hedge their locked tokens, (ii) secondary buyers to hedge exposure before an unlock, and (iii) traders to short in anticipation of a dump.\nExhibit F:\n\nThe launch of Internet Computer Protocol was one of the most memorable launches of the last cycle. Perpetual futures for ICP were launched five days before spot trading began across all major exchanges. ICP rallied over 400% coming into the launch, which was synonymous with the network\u2019s genesis, after which its perpetual downtrend commenced.\nOn May 10, 2021, investors accounted for ~37% of the token supply, founders/team members for ~62%, and the \u201ccommunity\u201d for a measly ~1%. The price per token was $0.035 for seed investors, $0.63 for strategic investors, and $4.17 for presale investors.\nThe ATH for ICP differs across exchanges, with the Binance spot market sitting at $2,831 and Coinbase at $630. Considering the latter, investors were up 151-18,000x, such that their collective allocation was valued at ~$110B. The founder/team allocation was valued at a whopping ~$183B. It would be unreasonable to not expect some degree of profit-taking. But even after a 90% decline from the top, investors would still be up 14-1,771x \u2013 levels at which they could joyfully continue selling.\n\nIntroducing perpetual futures days before launch allowed investors to hedge their positions and lock in a strong exit price. The $170M in OI coupled with extreme negative funding rates help substantiate the claim. Although speculators would\u2019ve made up a percentage of the OI, it is hard to believe that it amounted to $170M. The lack of required liquidity prevented these entities from fully hedging their locked tokens, but they were able to secure decent profits on partial positions.\nExhibit G:\nIt is widely believed that most perp listings result in sustained downtrends for tokens. Although partly true, the available liquidity at the beginning is often only enough for investors to hedge a fraction of their locked tokens.\n\nThe launch of perps for OXY is a great example. Investors were up about 110x at the highs. Their 1B tokens were worth over $4B. Yet, the OI on the contract never exceeded $14.4M.\nThe IEO price was $0.10, where most participants were retail. Unsurprisingly, after being up 44x, they realized profits, resulting in a decline. Secondary buyers cut their losses, as they were underwater. It stands to reason that the downtrend was not induced from hedging, but rather a lack of incremental buyers (due to the price appreciation, lack of utility, inflation schedule, price action, etc.) coupled with profit-taking.\nSolana had a vibrant OTC market, but this is not the norm. Yet, we still see some tokens performing positively as tokens unlock.\nExhibit H:\n\nThe most recent example that comes to mind is AXS. Roughly 21.5M (~$273M) tokens were expected to hit the market on Oct. 25, 2022. Yet, AXS began significantly underperforming the market after the beginning of the month \u2013 well before the unlock date. Investor tokens made up ~9.2%, staking rewards ~22.7%, the team ~26.6%, play-to-earn ~21.9%, ecosystem ~7.8%, and advisors ~11.65%.\nThe open interest (OI) was range-bound, but the average funding rates were negative. A week before the unlock, OI started skyrocketing, with average funding rates getting aggressively negative. The OI peaked at $193M a day before the unlock and then proceeded to unwind to pre-unlock levels. Simultaneously, the price rose by almost 19%.\n\nIt would be reasonable to assume that entities might\u2019ve partially hedged their AXS through perps and unwound the hedges as they received their tokens. This resulted in prices going up, and speculators playing the trend would have been forced to close. While unwinding their futures positions, the hedgers would\u2019ve unloaded their spot inventory. The cumulative volume delta is an indicator that goes up when a limit sell is filled and, conversely, goes down when a limit buy is filled. The CVD signatures on spot and perp markets on Binance give credence to this theory.\nExhibit I:\n\nYuga Labs made an announcement of an announcement leading up to a $100M+ APE coin unlock. The announcement was supposed to be made on Sep. 21, 2022, on Twitter Spaces, but members of the Horizen team fell ill. Their presence was required as they were responsible for building the APE staking protocol. The timing of the delay seemed suspicious to some, given that the market was struggling to shrug off the post-FOMC bloodbath.\n~77.3% of the unlocked tokens belonged to the investors and the rest to the treasury. Three days before the unlock, APE fell by over 20%. The OI at the time was $117M. On the unlock day, OI dropped to $84M, and funding started turning negative. The funding flip can be attributed to speculators aggressively shorting in anticipation of the unlock and the market correction. Moments after the unlock, OI started picking up, and APE followed suit by appreciating over 40%.\nLike AXS, the unlockers may have hedged their spot positions and, upon unlock, unwound futures while simultaneously selling spot. The lack of a reaction on the day may have pushed the speculators to close their positions willingly or by force, resulting in an uptick. Sidelined participants would\u2019ve piled in, facilitating the \u201cbullish unlock.\u201d\nThe last four exhibits reiterate the importance of liquidity when it comes to token unlocks. Ample liquidity allows \u201cbullish unlocks\u201d to transpire, although they are merely the priced-in versions of \u201cbearish unlocks.\u201d A lack of liquidity disallows \u201cbullish unlocks,\u201d as locked tokens are not fully-hedged and will be sold when unlocked. These assets still experience a perpetual downtrend thanks to the absence of incremental buyers.\nConclusion\nTokens are an integral part of crypto projects. Over the years, the way token economies are designed has changed considerably, becoming increasingly complex. They can help a good project prosper but fail to uphold inferior products.\nFully diluted valuations do matter, and arguably even more than MCs. The relative performance between a basket of high float vs. low float coins further supports this idea.\nStaking the native token for free money sounds good when viewed at face value. But, the situation seems grave when we break down the associated mechanics. Considerations about liquidity, lock-up period, dilution, R/R of staking, etc., become imperative.\nWith the advent of perpetual futures and the increasing prevalence of OTC markets, understanding a token unlock\u2019s impact becomes complicated. Professional investors cannot always hedge their investments because the liquidity required to do so often doesn\u2019t exist. This puts perpetual downward pressure on the token as it lacks willing incremental buyers. For tokens that possess the required liquidity, the unlocks sometimes result in positive price action \u2013 which is usually a priced-in version since the downward impact is felt some time before the actual unlock. Some projects go a step further and generate temporary liquidity through positive news.\nMost (if not all) projects distribute their tokens based on a predetermined schedule, often completely unrelated to the project\u2019s health. In certain cases, the incentive for the team and investors to continue developing and growing a project declines. This poses the question: how can we incentivize team members and investors to deliver without reducing their allocation?\nOne way of doing this would be by opting for milestone-based unlocks instead of time-based unlocks. The impact of the token unlocks wouldn\u2019t change, assuming the liquidity is low or the project suffers the low-float/high FDV curse. But, it does force the team and investors to deliver before receiving their tokens. Delivering a working product would bring in more users and, by extension, more demand. This could potentially translate into a reduced impact from a token unlock. Though this solution is far from the holy grail, it would be difficult to imagine where this structure doesn\u2019t fare better than the current structure.\nMilestones can vary depending on the type of project. For example, DeFi projects can have volume and utilization-based milestones; exchanges (both centralized and decentralized) can have user/volume-based milestones; L1s/L2s can have milestones based on user growth, transaction growth, or several other factors.  The benchmarks for these milestones can be derived by drawing optimal TVL/MC ratios, user/volume ratios, user/application ratios, etc., from the best-performing protocols of the respective sectors.\nOverall, crypto has some work to do in terms of perfecting token structures and creating conditions to lessen the impact of token unlocks. Figuring out which solutions work requires some experimentation from project teams. As the industry matures, teams start to figure out what makes a good token and the market becomes more efficient. We believe token unlocks could stop having such dramatic impacts on price, as dilution will be factored into pricing/valuation models.\nSpecial thanks to Cheryl Ho for designing the cover image for this report and to Ashwath Balakrishnan and Brian McRae for editing. \nPriyansh Patel\n\n\n\u2014-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPlay-to-Own: A Web3 Gaming Thesis\n\n\nArthur0x\n\u00b7\nFollow\n\u00b7\n383\n8\nThe Current Landscape of Web 3 Games\nVideo Games have evolved tremendously ever since the first labels were shipped to the open market in the 1970s. From the release of pay-to-play single class titles for the console and PC to freemium mobile games in the last decade, the gaming experience and business models have transformed in line with technological advances. Today, the gaming market is worth over $300B (according to both Accenture and BitKraft) with an expectation of 12% annual growth rate from 2022 to 2028.\nOur thesis is that the integration of Web 3 elements into gaming will likely usher in a new era of gaming dubbed \u201cPlay-to-Own\u201d. We posit that unlocking the economic activity within games will drastically expand the Total Addressable Market (\u201cTAM\u201d) for the gaming industry as well as supercharge the value creation.\nIn 2021, we caught a glimpse of the potential of Web3 Gaming via Axie Infinity\u2019s rise to fame. Popularizing the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model most of us are familiar with, Axie has grown from 10k DAUs in early 2021 to a peak of 3 million DAUs and brought in $1.3B revenue in 2021 according to Nansen. What\u2019s more surprising is that Axie was still in its infancy; the simple battle game was just a Beta version.\nAxie\u2019s parabolic growth signaled to the gaming industry the untapped potential of Web3 Gaming, inspiring a great influx of gaming talent into crypto. Stock prices of publicly-listed gaming studios have even re-rated upwards due to Web3 pivots and token launches.\nGames that integrated NFTs have experienced much greater success in terms of player retention, growth and revenues compared to their Web2 counterparts. We are already beginning to see a myriad of projects launching with innovative Play-and-Earn mechanics embedded within their gameplay. Apart from gaming studios, an entire ecosystem has also quickly spawned around Play-to-Earn like gaming guilds, DAOs, tooling for these guilds, game discovery platforms, custody, trading infrastructure and analytics.\nThe pitfalls of the current P2E model are well recognised, namely the challenges with managing an inflationary economy and attracting value extractors rather than real players. Most leading entrepreneurs in the Web3 gaming space are moving beyond this model to make it more sustainable. We expect rapid experimentation in the coming months and it is our firm belief that the next generation of successful Web 3 games will not require the P2E model to be successful.\nTo predict the future of Web3 games, we can look back into the history of business models in gaming for insights and the cumulative changes that brought us to this inflection point.\nParadigm Shifts in Business Model \u2014 Pay-to-Play, Free-to-Play, Play-to-Earn, Play-to-Own\nLooking back at the last 50 years of gaming, one can see multiple distinctive periods where business model innovation occurred along-side technological advancements.\nThe very first commercially successful video game business model was the Pay-to-Play model that was popularized by the arcade game Pong \u2014 gamers inserted coins into arcade machines, and played for a set amount of time or until they failed in-game levels. Arcade games tended to be simple but fun games that had competitive elements in the form of highscores that kept players coming back to play again and again.\nLater on, Pay-to-Play boxed retail games such as Diablo also took off alongside the rise in adoption of personal home computers and console gaming and allowed gamers to play from the comforts of their home. The drawbacks of Pay-to-play boxed retail games was that the revenue opportunity is once-off in nature \u2014 the only way for game developers to capitalize on this was to launch multiple series in cycles that typically took a few years.\nThe advancement of digital distribution technology that allowed live-service games alongside the desire of game developers to earn recurring revenue gave rise to the subscription-based Pay-to-Play model. In this model, gamers pay a fixed monthly fee to gain access to game content that is updated and enhanced regularly. Many successful games have utilized this model, including the venerable World of Warcraft which at its peak had more than 11.5 million monthly paying subscribers.\nWith the rise of mobile apps and the subsequent increase in preference for casual games, the Free-to-Play/Freemium model became popularized. In this model, the game\u2019s basic gameplay is completely free, however game publishers monetize via microtransactions. Examples of such microtransaction include Season passes and Loot boxes/Gacha which enables the players to get cosmetic items or other benefits that allow them to be more competitive vs other players either via faster leveling/stronger weapons.\nThe benefits of the freemium model was clear in that it allowed users to easily start playing the game and provided a recurring revenue stream for the game developers. However as time went on, developers pushed harder and harder on the monetization aspects and it disappointed gamers as they felt the increasingly strong \u201ccash grab\u201d behavior from developers and felt that gameplay loops were increasingly affected by \u201cPay-to-Win\u201d players who could pay to achieve in-game success.\nA common thread across these business model evolutions was that game developers increasingly leaned towards extracting more lifetime value from players while committing the minimum effort and", "doc_id": "505b0c85-f4b6-4b21-855e-df82763bea9f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "132eedfb0384d5042e12c3e8b74d966d0960b0d475ed11dd3b7d8945d6d644f7", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 133315, "end": 148308}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "081e9208-3e27-4189-90b8-36e2eda94348", "3": "fc349e59-c14b-493c-9948-72d1f587bb30"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc349e59-c14b-493c-9948-72d1f587bb30": {"text": "passes and Loot boxes/Gacha which enables the players to get cosmetic items or other benefits that allow them to be more competitive vs other players either via faster leveling/stronger weapons.\nThe benefits of the freemium model was clear in that it allowed users to easily start playing the game and provided a recurring revenue stream for the game developers. However as time went on, developers pushed harder and harder on the monetization aspects and it disappointed gamers as they felt the increasingly strong \u201ccash grab\u201d behavior from developers and felt that gameplay loops were increasingly affected by \u201cPay-to-Win\u201d players who could pay to achieve in-game success.\nA common thread across these business model evolutions was that game developers increasingly leaned towards extracting more lifetime value from players while committing the minimum effort and cost.\nThe objective function has shifted towards profit at the cost of fairness: from products designed to deliver fun experiences to hyper-optimized businesses designed to make the player spend as much money as possible. This has been enabled via the increased granularity of data harvested to understand player behaviors and how to monetize users through predatory schemes.\nIn many cases, items that players grinded for are inflated away or nerfed unfairly in favor of new items sold through primary sales with revenues going to the developer. The concept of true ownership of in-game assets does not exist as players find their efforts are worth nothing of value once they decide to stop playing the game.\nAt the same time, a fundamental issue of incentive misalignment was present. Decision making of an entire game ecosystem was made by developers who may not take into consideration the views of the community. There is rarely any intention or ways to compensate players and creators who contributed to the success of the games through their efforts.\nPlay-to-Earn \u2014 Incentivising gameplay with financial value\nUtilizing blockchain technology, token incentives for activity and true ownership of gaming assets via NFTs were introduced into games to give rise to the Play-to-Earn business model. P2E players are able to convert their time spent in a game into tokens and NFTs which can then be converted to cash to be used in the real world. Typically in such games, the \u201cEarn\u201d component of the game is heavily emphasized to attract players to play for rewards, hoping that a portion will be converted into paying players.\nIn Axie Infinity, players at one point were able to earn more than USD $200 per day if they were in a high MMR bracket. In developing countries such as the Philippines, this amount can be much higher than the minimum daily wage of ~USD$10. However, it is unwise to rely on games as jobs as token prices experience large fluctuations and are unable to sustain prices if supply exceeds demand. A nascent game economy with limited depth of content will not be able to support a player base that is predominantly value extracting.\nIn the open economies of Play-to-Earn games, the health of the economy becomes paramount and there is an ever-pressing need to ensure that token faucets and sinks are balanced such that the value of the core currency and items are stable. Limiting the amount of speculation in a nascent economy is also important to limit the degradation of user experience due to volatility.\nFollowing Axie\u2019s footsteps, we have seen some P2E games try to emulate their success. Most have struggled with overly high inflation of their in-game currency due to poor economic design and management \u2014 a high percentage of players cashing out causes a death spiral where as token prices drop, earnings of players drop, and they stop playing the game because their main reason for playing is to earn financial yield.\nPlay-to-Own \u2014 The Future of Web 3 Gaming\nFrom Axie Infinity, we learnt that in the initial bootstrapping phase of the game economy, early believers and participants who are mainly driven by financial return take on the risk to acquire assets and work to mine resources to sell them to later entrants.\nHowever, as incentives cannot subsidize growth forever, game developers will have to find ways to convert yield seekers into consumers in a sustainable game economy.\nWhile this can be done in the short term through adjusting faucets and introducing new token sinks, organic spending can only be sustained via a constant stream of novel fun content and experiences that players would want to pay for without any expectation of financial return. Building immersive worlds and characters that are loved by the community is the most sustainable way to grow a game.\nWe believe that Play-to-Own will be the next evolution in gaming business models. Games are not jobs and should not emphasize the ability to earn money from playing. This terminology reflects the need to align both players and owners of a game as well as an understanding of NFT technology, which are all about improved ownership.\nWe define Play-to-Own as:\n\u201cA blockchain-enabled game developed with the ethos of Web3 \u2014 which is incentive alignment and true stakeholder ownership. Players are rewarded for their play and contributions with ownership of the game in the form of tokens or in-game assets.\u201d\nUnlike pure P2E, Play-to-Own will focus on fun gameplay, a sustainable economy and foster a strong sense of ownership of in-game assets and IP \u2014 rather than a transient earning mentality among gamers. We believe this model will allow games to reap the real benefits of blockchains such as unlocking value from in-game assets, better price discovery and building a strong sense of community ownership.\nThe term implies an active effort to actually play games in the way they are intended to be experienced in order to be rewarded with ownership of valuable assets rather than mindless click-farming that is ingrained in typical poorly designed play-to-earn games.\nFurthermore, we believe that Play-to-Own games will have very low barriers for new players to start playing and will give out sustainable amounts of rewards as a user acquisition strategy.\nFor example, the game could be Free-to-Play at the start, allowing players to earn small rewards which are reinvested back into the game to acquire valuable game assets. Alternatively, users may be able to easily rent NFT assets from marketplaces via profit sharing agreements and compete at a high level without spending a fortune upfront.\nNansen has a great visual explainer for the stakeholder mapping in Web3 games:\n\nUltimately, we see Play-to-Own as a positive sum game \u2014 a simplified mental model:\n\nWe predict that player spending will be an order of magnitude greater than revenues seen in Web2 games and Web3 games transition to Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) as a metric to measure all transactions within the virtual economy.\nCrucially, there will be net value creation (+$10 in this example from $10 to $20) to the ecosystem that is shared between developers and community. With sound economy management and deep gameplay content, Play-to-Own will be much more sustainable compared to Play-to-Earn, generating revenues for developers and community over a much longer period of time.\nPush & Pull Factors accelerating the Play-to-Own movement\nApproaching this paradigm shift from first principles, we believe that the acceleration into Play-to-Own is supported by a combination of incentive misalignment in the current business models and the value propositions that Web3 provides:\nMisalignment of Incentives in Web2 Games (Push Factor)\nPush #1: Gamers will always seek to monetize their time spent on games and the ability to flex online wherever possible\nEmpirically, we know that it is natural for gamers to seek out ways to monetize time spent in games and to showcase the best game cosmetics.\nIn-game trading houses like the Grand Exchange in Runescape have taught a generation of players the economic aspects of games. Gold farming & account boosting operations are also common in popular MMOs or MOBAs. Players have internal mental models for what is valuable within games (this can range from rare loot, hidden content to entire accounts) and trading these valuable items for money is always a thought when quitting a game.\nThe restrictive economies of current games will push more players who understand the value of virtual items into Web3 games where the tokenization of in-game resources and assets reduces friction in exchanging value, therefore unlocking more economic activity.\nThese digital natives also increasingly favor digital flexes as time spent online increases; however, it is difficult to justify large amounts of spending into the game as the flow of value into the game is one-directional.\nWith NFTs that can be resold, the flow of value can be bi-directional. The shift in mindsets of gamers from pure consumption to asset ownership should increase the TAM of games significantly as players can psychologically justify spending when asset values can both grow and be sold to recover some residual value.\nA huge barrier to usage of decentralized applications has always been the apprehension when it comes to self custody of funds and sending on-chain transactions via wallets like Metamask. However, we believe this is less of an issue for gamers who are accustomed to managing game accounts with high valued items and in-game currency.\nPush #2: Disappointment with game developers due to incentive misalignment between developers and players.\nMost games now are products of ROI-driven investments instead of fun and playability focused. The objective of game companies is to extract the maximum amount of money while spending the least resources on players. Investor pressure, costly overheads & strict timelines to deliver can also result in the sale of unfinished products to players.\nThere have been numerous cases in recent years where the player\u2019s trust was betrayed due to the failure to deliver a satisfactory gameplay experience after successive hyped trailers and teasers.\nThe list goes on: expensive paywalled content, unfair game patches that nerf items that players have painstakingly earned in favor of new drops, prohibitive microtransactions, intrusive advertisements, low quality battle passes, lack of support for past season\u2019s cosmetics when they break in-game\u2026\nAs cash grabs become more blatant and promises broken, the player community feels increasingly disrespected and jaded with game studios.\nPush #3: Game developers & publishers can and have abused UGC creators for their own bottom line without consulting the community.\nCurrently, user-generated content (UGC) creators pay high take rates for their work and in certain instances, may not be compensated at all. Game publishers can easily change the rules and royalty payouts as seen in Steam\u2019s case.\nAn interesting example to study is Defense of the Ancients (popularly known as DOTA) which was a UGC game mode of Blizzard\u2019s Warcraft 3 and had driven a huge influx of people to the game. It is still unclear how much the creators of the mod were able to monetize from this success. Eventually the active developers of the mod moved on to work at Valve for DOTA2.\nIn a Web3 game, royalties enforced via smart contracts give professional UGC creators confidence to build their business on top of the game. This results in higher quality work delivered to the community and a top quality UGC market.\nIn addition, a significantly larger percentage of creators can make a living and benefit from their creative talents when token incentives are used to supercharge UGC efforts. At the same time, this unlocks the limits on the speed of content generation within the game. Any changes to the royalty splits can be put up for votes by stakeholders and a more healthy discourse can ensue.\nValue Proposition of Web3 Games (Pull Factor)\nPull #1: Deeper liquidity of secondary market leading to greater trading volumes and revenues\nThe open and trustless economy built on the blockchain enables a vibrant secondary market for game assets. Prices of items are set by market forces and natural demand & supply, barring interventions by game developers.\nGame developers can have an alternative monetization strategy that is based on transaction fees and secondary market trading royalties enabled by smart contracts. Assets can be liquidated freely and players can recover some financial value derived from the time, effort and money they have invested into the game.\nWe believe that this will lead to a significant increase in the TAM of the gaming industry in the long run.\nPull #2: Web3 games align incentives between players, investors and developers. As a result, there is strong player empowerment and community stewardship as everyone is invested in the success of the game.\nCurrently, a game\u2019s community does not have a direct way to grow alongside the success of the games and share any form of financial upside.\nPlayers typically have no say in the game development direction as most games are playtested behind closed doors. Game revenues are also never shared with players and early believers even though they are a huge reason for the success of games.\nNFTs and token-powered games offer a solution where the players can have financial exposure to the game tokens early on as well as after games have launched.\nIn the early development phase, game devs can identify and involve some of these passionate holders in the game-building process. These early believers who have sufficient reputation or skin in the game can also be polled for their views on how the game should evolve.\nAs the game launches, governance tokens allow community participation in governance and stewardship of the game. Open channels of communication builds trust and understanding, driving deeper engagement as players have a way to make their voices heard by developers.\nPull #3: New forms of user acquisition due to interoperability of assets, play history and usage of tokens\nPermissionless and open environments allow game developers to integrate 3rd party NFT assets (or even assets from other games) by creating special custom cosmetics to be used in their own game. Developers can look for the communities that look the most fervent or best fit their targeted personas to market their games.\nAs tools to determine legitimate wallet activity matures, a player\u2019s onchain history or metaverse profile can be accessed and targeted by other games for user acquisition and airdrops. This creates win-win situations where game developers have a new form of user acquisition while strengthening the IP, utility and network effect across integrated NFT assets.\nOwnership of tokens and NFTs help in organic marketing as the community become effective evangelists of the game with minimal spend of marketing budget.\nPull #4: Fundraising capability of game studios improve with the usage of Web 3\nThe earlier liquidity provided through token investments rather than equity has helped blockchain gaming projects raise funds from institutional investors due to less perceived risk of exit. According to a report from Dappradar and BGA, a total of $4B was raised in 2021 for the blockchain gaming sector specifically. In comparison, the total funding for traditional gaming startups was $4.7B in 2020.\nSale of future in-game assets as NFTs can help to raise substantial amounts of money that financially de-risks gaming projects so development efforts will be less constricted by tight budgets. The ability to resell on secondary markets freely makes it an easier purchase to make.\nOther than pure speculation of assets, we see that players are willing to contribute funds to make their wishes a reality. As the market matures, players will choose to fund mostly the projects that show accountability on development progress and traction on community building.\nWhat should a Successful Web3 Game look like?\nTo fully embrace the benefits of building in Web3, we think that developers should be executing on the following core elements:\n#1 Intricate world-building and growing the Intellectual Property (IP)\nSimply put, when there are a ton of activities to do within the world, players spend more time inside which has a direct", "doc_id": "fc349e59-c14b-493c-9948-72d1f587bb30", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "417bc47758641efa8bb7e15df143f37577b69daa5d315790faf4e290bfdbbfe9", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 148206, "end": 164444}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "505b0c85-f4b6-4b21-855e-df82763bea9f", "3": "d2f48605-3eab-4006-bdc3-a3225715839f"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2f48605-3eab-4006-bdc3-a3225715839f": {"text": "to raise substantial amounts of money that financially de-risks gaming projects so development efforts will be less constricted by tight budgets. The ability to resell on secondary markets freely makes it an easier purchase to make.\nOther than pure speculation of assets, we see that players are willing to contribute funds to make their wishes a reality. As the market matures, players will choose to fund mostly the projects that show accountability on development progress and traction on community building.\nWhat should a Successful Web3 Game look like?\nTo fully embrace the benefits of building in Web3, we think that developers should be executing on the following core elements:\n#1 Intricate world-building and growing the Intellectual Property (IP)\nSimply put, when there are a ton of activities to do within the world, players spend more time inside which has a direct correlation with money spent on the game.\nDesigning the game universe to be composable with a wide range of ideas enable a hotbed of UGC as the community steps in to create stories and characters. A strong emotional attachment to the game and IP is formed when the community is involved in world-building. Having a transmedia content strategy to reach the audience via a variety of mediums will be crucial for this objective.\nSeparately, developers should socially coordinate around common technical standards and actively champion for their adoption to improve asset portability into various virtual game worlds. As more 3rd party titles and content creators integrate the original NFT assets, the value of IP increases with the growth in attention and awareness.\n#2 Immersive social and MMO experience\nA high degree of customization, identity-building and social interactivity should be emphasized. As more attention is paid to in-game avatars and property, the impetus to spend and showcase gets stronger. This encourages consumption in the virtual economy.\nA rewarding multiplayer experience in both PvE and PvP increases interactivity and social elements of the game. Prestige in climbing the leaderboards and guild-vs-guild wars also cater to the competitive nature of players, encouraging spending to stay at the top.\nMeeting the player\u2019s psychological needs and bringing them into the \u201cmagic circle\u201d is where games will find success in making the player forget about the open economy where assets are financialised.\n#3 Deep economic metagames\nSkill and effort should be rewarded more than passive gameplay or pure spending as these players are likely higher value customers who will reinvest back into the economy. A steady cadence of content patches and live ops campaigns is needed to encourage a vibrant secondary trading market for materials and valuable items, boosting the game\u2019s royalty revenues.\nToken inflation is a tool for user acquisition and retention in the bootstrapping phase of the economy. Developers will need to monitor key economic metrics to adjust sinks and faucets, and actively manage the health of the economy over time. The goal is to strive for stability in the underlying token-based currencies by keeping inflation in line with the growth of the player base. In-game businesses and operations can only be set up when there is confidence in the long term stability of the economy.\nThe open economy can be a double edge sword if speculation is not limited in the early stages. Economy designers should devise ways to protect the nascent economy from extreme volatility and misuse of assets. This can come in the form of direct and indirect taxes on trade and asset possession.\nOverall, the goals for the game and the player need to be aligned \u2014 the game\u2019s success and earnings should be predicated on the players deriving value from both entertainment and financial returns.\n#4 Gradual democratization of the game\nTo prolong game lifecycles, decisions should be collectively made by developers with input from invested and reputable stakeholders from the community. A well-governed community-owned game should increase engagement and retention as the community\u2019s views are represented.\nIt is also important to plan ahead for scenarios where a game\u2019s economy is so huge that nation-state actors may engage in censorship. A decentralized technology stack will be essential in ensuring the longevity of the game while maintaining an uncensorable nature. This may apply for more mature games.\nOpen sourcing game codes may be crucial as well to ensure the community has the ability to fork the game, preserving the continuity of the virtual economy if developers are deemed to be poor stewards of the game. We envision that there may be different teams of developers hired to create content and maintain live operations for the game, players may vote at the end of each season whether they are competent in growing the game & retaining players.\nOur Evaluation Framework\nSuccess of a Game is a function of Product, Distribution and Economic Balance, driven by a competent Team. A snippet of our evaluation process:\n#1 Team pedigree. We love to see a good mix of game development and cryptonative talent with a strong vision for the game.\nShipping a game successfully requires the ability to attract and retain talent, allocate resources efficiently, and orchestrate efforts across functional teams such as art, music, tech (often times 100+ people). With such complexity, it is unsurprising to see games being delayed for long periods of time and failing to launch.\nIn addition, knowing the distribution channels (publishers and marketing partners) and methods to build hype are key in a successful launch. Even after launch, it is crucial to maintain cadence for live services \u2014 to generate new content, gameplay patches for the players to lengthen the game lifecycle.\nFor Web3 games, crypto-native experience comes into play as business models are different. Teams should possess deep knowledge on how to launch and drive value accrual to tokens & NFTs; manage treasuries and incentive programs; mechanisms offered by smart contracts (e.g staking) that a web3 game can take advantage of to kickstart flywheels and supercharge growth. Community building should be second nature \u2014 maintaining clear communication and accountability to build trust and a passionate community of players, contributors and owners of the game.\nEssentially, the Team creates the base layer for the ecosystem to thrive and are stewards of the grand vision. Having experienced people that have actually shipped games while possessing the genuine passion for Web3 will be critical to success.\n#2 Product and Distribution. A fun game that can reach a wide audience that is willing to spend.\nOne question we love to ask ourselves is whether we can envision ourselves spending time and money on the concept if there was no potential return?\nThe game should be tested and iterated upon until there is sufficient confidence in the game loops before official launch. An open iterative approach to gamebuilding with the community helps in this regard. Differentiated game loops should be designed to accommodate diverse groups of stakeholders who each optimize for their own definitions of winning.\nFree-to-Play players who are casually spending time and effort for enjoyment\nHardcore players that raid the most difficult dungeons and compete for Player-versus-Player and Guild-versus-Guild leaderboard positions\nCreatives that help design and build in-game areas and experiences\nMerchants and traders that speculate on economic resources and the metagame\nA good understanding of the target player base and how to acquire them via the most effective distribution channels is essential. Marketing partners, launch campaigns & community building efforts need to be planned out in advance to ensure a successful launch.\nTo improve the onboarding process and retention of playe or mobile applications to enable higher conversion rates.rs, developers also need to abstract away the blockchain experience where necessary. Tokens and game assets will need to be easily accessible to players within game clients\n#3 Economic sustainability: managing inflation and dampening volatility in the economy\nWe think that the health of the economy is crucial to the longevity of the game. As the blockchain unlocks the virtual ingame economy, it is imperative to model out faucets and sinks in the game and build in the macro levers that can be adjusted to balance token inflation against player growth.\nControlling and converting speculators and value extractors of the economy into consumers will be an important endeavor. In the long term, having good content that intrinsically motivates people to spend is the only way to build effective sinks that reduce the impact of inflationary rewards.\nMajor changes in game loops and economy should be delicately balanced and communicated with input from community stakeholders. Developers should strive for a sound token design that ensures all fungible and non-fungible tokens within the ecosystem have clear utility and value accrual.\nThesis: The Best Games will form the Metaverse\nWe believe that the underlying blockchain technology is technically ready for what games require to target mainstream audiences. What needs to be innovated upon now is the user experience problem (asset custody, gas payments, bridging requirements etc). Developers should try to educate the difference between onchain and offchain assets, abstract away the complexities while slowly introducing the onchain elements for more advanced users.\nThe most obvious genres that are best suited to leverage Web3 elements are MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games) like World of Warcraft and 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate) strategy games like Clash of Clans due to the deep economic & social gameplay loops. Usage of blockchain technology will also result in 0 to 1 innovations in game design and create new genres due to the possibility of storing of assets and game logic onchain.\nResearching the current design space in gaming, we are excited for both \u201cTop-Down\u201d and \u201cBottom-Up\u201d approaches to building a Web3 game \u2014 cognizant of the different set of challenges encountered by each. Below is a table of stereotypical profile of the two approaches:\n\nFollowing our thesis, we invest across games and ancillary infrastructures like guilds and game discovery platforms. We avoid teams building casual games that have short life cycles and \u201cGameFi\u201d, which we define as zero sum games with the only objective being to achieve the greatest financial return \u2014 they are essentially a gamified frontend over the same tired ponzi yield farming mechanisms.\nOur approach is to actively support long term oriented projects which are delivering fun content and experiences with a focus on a sustainable game economy \u2014 executing across all value propositions of being a Web3 game. The most successful ones eventually form a core part of the Metaverse where the game holds immense influence on the digital realities of a huge player base.\nThe Bull Case\nFrom the level of talent we see coming into the space, we are reasonably confident that the next generation defining franchises will be built on Web3 \u2014 flipping around the prevailing negative sentiment on Play-to-Own games that utilize NFTs.\nWe believe that having games built on open peer-to-peer networks will unlock greater economic value and drastically expand the Total Addressable Market (\u201cTAM\u201d) for the Gaming industry \u2014 with expectations of a trillion dollars in economic output to surface within the next 10 years.\nWe eagerly invest to bring forth such a future where real value flows to and from virtual worlds where experiences are as real as the physical world and DeFi emerge as the financial tools to serve these onchain economies.\nIf you are building something that resonates with what we have written, we\u2019d be keen to learn more!\nAuthors: Arthur @Arthur0x, Bailey @bottomd0g, David @davidkohcw\nWeb3\nCryptocurrency\nBlockchain\nGaming\n383\n8\n\n\nWritten by Arthur0x\n209 Followers\n\u00b7\nEditor for\nDeFiance Capital\nFounder of DeFiance Capital, Web3 & Crypto Investor\n\n\n\u2014------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroducing: MetaPortal DAO\nA research DAO focused on governance and token value accrual design for crypto games\n\n\n\nAG, DARKFORESTCAPITAL, AND PETER 'PET3RPAN'\nMAY 23, 2022\n4\nShare\nMetaPortal initially emerged from DFC and AG working together on the Metaverse Index as part of the Index Cooperative DAO. So far, we have focused on building two index products, the Metaverse Index and the MetaPortal Gaming Index. In addition to managing the indices, we produce written content (deep-dive research, macro pieces, weekly gaming roundup, etc.), work with PrimeDAO on rating Metaverse projects, and occasionally make angel investments across the space (Alethea, MetaMundo, etc.)\nWith MetaPortal DAO, we aim to evolve MetaPortal into a research DAO focused on governance and token value accrual design for crypto games.\nVision for MetaPortal DAO\nOur vision for the DAO is heavily influenced by 1kx\u2019s Service DAO model and the premise that capital in crypto is effectively commoditized and that, in some cases, Service DAOs might be a better source of funding, domain expertise and value-add than traditional VCs.\nMetaPortal DAO aims to be a world-class research DAO focused on designing decentralized governance and token value accrual models across the gaming ecosystem. We intend to bring in a curated group of focused, high-impact contributors, initially keeping the core team rather small.\nWhile our primary focus will be the advisory work with gaming projects, we also envision building out internal analytics capabilities as a core part of our mandate. Analytics can help identify areas of improvement within existing gaming ecosystems as well as provide valuable information for the design of new ones.\nOver the last couple of months, we have been working closely with 1kx on bootstrapping the MetaPortal DAO and sourcing initial advisory engagements. They will continue to be involved in a part-time capacity as we get up and running, eventually shifting to a more of an advisory role.\nSome of our work so far\nSinks & Faucets: Lessons on Designing Effective Virtual Game Economies\nPower To The Players\nGame Governance - A Summary of Purpose and Structures\nThe Current State of Crypto Gaming\n\nProblems we want to help solve\nGovernance\nHow can virtual economies better scale governance?\nWhich coordination models can we apply or design for game governance?\nHow can virtual economies establish more effective governance?\nHow can virtual economies better reward community contributions?\nValue accrual\nHow can virtual economies improve value accrual?\nHow can virtual economies better bootstrap initial NFT / asset economy distributions?\nHow can games improve retention through token design?\nWe are looking for contributors\nWith the launch of the MetaPortal DAO, we are looking for contributors:\nResearchers interested in \nSolving community governance at a scale\nExploring new token models and value accrual mechanisms in crypto gaming\nMechanism designers\nData scientists\nGame economists\nGame historians\nCommunity coordinators\nDiscord mod (lol)\nAny general loveable nerds who have been playing games for the last 20 years and want to help build the future of crypto gaming.\nApply here to express interest in contributing to this DAO.\nIn the meantime, jump into our Discord.\n\n\u2014------------------------------\n\n\n\nRealms (for Adventurers)\n@LootRealms\n\u00b7\nMar 22\nThe $Lords token is the native currency of the Realms universe.

Despite the hype and the consensus among the crypto community that crypto-gaming is the future, we\u2019ve encountered both nebulous explanations of its benefits and legitimate arguments by established gamers as to why it will not work. We want to address both and discuss through the lens of our personal experiences and frustrations with games symbolic of our 2000s childhoods, six reasons why crypto will change gaming. We hope to propose novel applications or ideas in each section and provide a brief overview of existing arguments.\nAs always, if you\u2019ve enjoyed this article please follow us on Twitter @terry15chung and @stingrayL0.\nThis article builds on and is inspired by, \u201cInto the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Metaverse\u201d - we credit sections 1, 2, and 3 to this article. If you would like a more comprehensive overview of pillars 1, 2, and 3, we highly suggest reading this article first. Our previous work on Axie also touches on this as well - check out the section titled \u201cIt's Just a Game\u201d.\nTable of Contents\nDefinitions and Background\nPillar 1: Asset Ownership\nPillar 2: Transactions and Payments\nPillar 3: Interoperability\nPillar 4: Game Governance\nPillar 5: Reward Contributors\nPillar 6: Open Source\nRedefining the Future of Work?\nTl;dr\nPillar 1: Asset Ownership\nNFTs allow you to keep in-game items even if the game shuts down\nSelf-custody means you can use it in other interoperable projects\nNFTs can represent rights to access a game + other perks that give new monetization models to game devs\nNFTs tell a story through the provable history of ownership that can make gameplay more immersive.\nPillar 2: Transactions and Payments\nTrustless marketplaces distribute margin from large marketplaces and sellers to individual sellers\nRMT without fear of fraud.\nPillar 3: Interoperability\nContent and tokens can be interoperable - NFTs in one game can have representation in others.\nPillar 4: Game Governance\nGames allow provable on-chain proof of participation\nThis allows the creation of new governance models that address the issues with coin-voting, that make tradeoffs between Sybil resistance and plutocracy\nThis proof of participation model can be tweaked to solve for gerontocracy or account buying (more on this model later).\nPillar 5: Reward Contributors\nWith crypto, we can now reward contributors with currency native to the game.\nThis is also important in rewarding developers, marketers, and other contributors to the protocol if the game is fully decentralized.\nPillar 6: Open Source\nBecause blockchain games are open source, they can be forked to return to previous versions\nThis, combined with decentralized game governance allows organic dissipation of the incessant pressure to update for game developers.\nRedefining the Future of Work?\nThrough having a global system that is not disadvantageous to smaller players, we can provide meaningful wages to those who satisfy the demand for in-game currency or assets\nCrypto-gaming can help alleviate the geographical lottery in ways that even working in regional software businesses cannot\nFinally, we hope that there isn\u2019t an over-finalization of gaming as the ultimate purpose is still to have fun. We should use NFTs and crypto to add immersion and never forget that the end goal is to build enjoyable consumer experiences.\nBackground:\nWe want to start by first clarifying the differences between how we will use the terms \u201cNFT Gaming\u201d, and \u201cBlockchain Gaming\u201d.\nNFT Games have in-game assets that are NFTs. Just because a game incorporates NFTs, does not necessarily mean its game logic runs on a blockchain, or that it is decentralized. Similarly, games could decide to issue tokens and decentralize but omit NFTs altogether.\n\u201cBlockchain games\u201d host their game logic directly on public blockchains. Congruently, it does not have to incorporate NFTs or have a crypto-currency tied to the ecosystem (you get the point).\nWe will refer to games that use any blockchain technology as \u201ccrypto-games\u201d.\nNote: Because this space is so new, our general definitions will probably have changed by this time next year. NFTs are social by nature, so our discussion focuses exclusively on multiplayer games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 1: Asset Ownership\n2008 - I had just made some friends after moving to a new school. A bunch of us boys was hanging out in front of my best friend\u2019s computer during a sleepover where we came across...\n\n\u201cLooks fun - could use a break from Age of Empires 2\u201d\nBy 2010 we were still throwing snowballs at the basketball hoop as we complained about our homework that day. We had our Secret Agent Badge and Black Belt proudly equipped for all to see. Hanging out in Club Penguin was definitely a highlight of my lower-school years.\nEarly 2017, I had just found out that Club Penguin was shutting down a month later (March 2017). So my friends and I logged in one last time to shoot some snowballs at the basketball court while we threatened to report anyone who dared try to type \u201cIdiot\u201d with our Special Agent privileges.\nLosing Games and Game Items\nWhether it\u2019s a mount in WoW or my Puffle and igloo in Club Penguin losing in game-assets is an upsetting experience that is, unfortunately, the fact of life. Whether it\u2019s the dozens of Reddit pages and forums, there are people frustrated with losing items in their games or MMOs that have closed down over the years. Losing something they spent so much time, effort, and money to acquire. This is especially true in the case of MMORPGs, where people built whole identities and communities around their account, only for those to disappear when the game became unprofitable to maintain for the studio.\n\n:(\nHere's an example of the unthinkable becoming reality: an MMO that disappeared overnight.\nSo How Does Crypto Help?\nIf my Puffle or Penguin avatar had been an NFT, it could exist independently of whether Disney shuts Club Penguin down or not. If other games or individual users so desired, these NFTs could still have use-cases (see Pillar 3, 6) from user spun-up derivative games/experiences.\nTo better understand this dynamic and why it is important (past your experience with Club Penguin) check out \u201cInto the Void: Where Crypto Meets the Open Metaverse.\u201d\nIn this section, we want to build on the article above to muse about additional use-cases on how in-game asset ownership can transform gaming.\nBuying and Selling of Games (Again)\nAccessing games through a DRM (Digital Rights Management) platform like Steam or Microsoft Store means you get a license to play games through their server. You don\u2019t actually own the game.\nI remember the good old days when I traded my Smash Bros for a Blazing Angels CD. Every CD and cartridge that my friends had, was also another game I had access to - when we were bored of playing one game, we were happy to sell, swap, and gift it to each other.\nToday, I have over 120 games on Steam, and I have no idea what to do with them. I can't sell, lease or gift them on a game-by-game basis nor can I sell my Steam account since it contains sensitive personal information and breaks TOS (terms of service). And frankly, there is a level of confusion about having just \u201cpurchased\u201d something and being told that I cannot do anything with it past playing the game; it seems like we aren\u2019t the only ones following this train of logic.\nYet Steam can\u2019t put it more directly that you do not in fact own the game. From Steam\u2019s TOS:\nValve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use\u2026\nAll title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Content and Services and any and all copies thereof are owned by Valve\u2026\nYou are entitled to use the Content and Services for your own personal use, but you are not entitled to (i) sell, grant a security interest in, or transfer reproductions of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others\u2026\nInstead of digital licenses, NFTs could be used to authenticate access to a game. This is already the case for Axie Infinity, where you must own 3 Axies to play. You\u2019re then allowed to sell, gift, breed\u2026etc those Axies anytime you wish. This now means that you can resell access to your old games, buy games on the secondary market, and lend/rent access to games through NFT renting protocols like reNFT.\nSo perhaps before you purchase a game you want to try playing it for a while, or you\u2019re finally finished with a game and want to resell it at market prices. Perhaps you want to create social communities around verified ownership of some game, or even guilds with requirements of verification of on-chain data about your in-game status (levels, land-possession, faction allegiance...etc). With NFTs representing in-game assets, or replacing digital licenses, you unlock a richer user experience around gaming.\nBut what about the Game Developers\nIf everyone could just buy/sell/trade their games with someone else, then how are they going to make money?\nFirst, NFTs can create new monetization models. Game developers can embed NFTs with a royalty fee so that each time in-game assets get traded, they (or a designated address - a treasury) automatically receive the fees. The same idea applies if the NFT assets represent ownership of the game itself. Axie relies on this model and is one of the top revenue-generating games of 2021.\nFurthermore, game developers can offer additional interoperable experiences, lowering the cost barrier for new players while increasing price discrimination. Imagine a game studio that has developed a large game and many mini-games that all can be played entirely independently of each other. These games are related and are all part of a core story/game universe. Purchasing NFT A could allow players to access A mini-game, but they must buy NFT B if they want to access the B mini-game...etc. If they decide that they like what they\u2019re playing, then they could buy the more expensive NFT Z. The different NFTs that I now own can now act as either unique characters, passes to enter certain areas in the big game, or be combined/composed into unique items while still providing access to the different minigames that are part of the same core universe.\nThe difference between this and the current DLC model is that each NFT is independent of one another. If the area that A NFT unlocks in the main game is no longer interesting to a player, they could sell that NFT individually. Or if they no longer have the time to play games, they could sell everything except for NFT A which to them is the most fun and least time-consuming.\nThese NFTs also don\u2019t have to be as expensive as DLCs or purchasing games today. With new post-purchase monetization models available to game studios, initial purchase prices could be even lower than DLCs today.\nCapturing Value\nWhat is valuable in a game?\nPerhaps it's \u201cwhatever lets us have the most fun\u201d, but with that, we turn into the realm of subjectivity. A gorgeous-looking sword with mediocre stats may be welcomed by a more aesthetically conscious player but frowned upon by a stat-only player who wants the best gear.\n\nClassic Dilemma\nWe conjecture that with in-game items the 4 main factors that contribute to \u201cwhat is valuable\u201d are authenticity, scarcity, utility, and story.\nAuthenticity, utility, and scarcity are generally well captured in the current gaming environment. If you know that a legendary item is super powerful, has a low drop rate, and is useful to you, you probably spend a lot of effort obtaining it and purchasing it at a high price, and because games today are closed environments, the question of authenticity is trivial.\nHowever, the value of the story, in our opinion, isn\u2019t captured well at all. For example, when you buy an art piece, the curator can usually provide historical background on the piece, like whether its previous owner was someone famous, a crazy story of how it was rediscovered, or a story behind its creation. These stories are what sometimes make art valuable and engaging - when you purchase a piece, you aren\u2019t just buying its visual representation, but its historical context (where and how it was made), its lineage (which walls it has hung on), and its overall story.\nUnfortunately, stories like this are rarely captured in in-game assets on a noticeable level, which we believe is a massive missed opportunity. Imagine how valuable it would be for some hardcore fans of Hiko to find out they were buying was the exact StatTrak P2000 Corticera skin he used to execute the inhuman reaction headshot. But more importantly imagine the level of immersion this can bring into gameplay - the level of pride at owning the exact skin used by Faker, the exact whip used by Durial321 during the Fally massacre (this point is expanded upon in Pillar 5). Because the history of ownership is easily verifiable, items take on a story and a lineage, increasing its value but also", "doc_id": "e37cd58d-15c7-4805-8ac1-51e9da7824fc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "388cd6104f22b75cc9707a6cfe56b323161e00fcc9028a90796b1c715c1628d6", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 180489, "end": 195146}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "d2f48605-3eab-4006-bdc3-a3225715839f", "3": "dc43ab29-ffea-4ac8-a76f-6b8782a1b7c0"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc43ab29-ffea-4ac8-a76f-6b8782a1b7c0": {"text": "and how it was made), its lineage (which walls it has hung on), and its overall story.\nUnfortunately, stories like this are rarely captured in in-game assets on a noticeable level, which we believe is a massive missed opportunity.

But more importantly imagine the level of immersion this can bring into gameplay - the level of pride at owning the exact skin used by Faker, the exact whip used by Durial321 during the Fally massacre (this point is expanded upon in Pillar 5). Because the history of ownership is easily verifiable, items take on a story and a lineage, increasing its value but also creating more immersive experiences in gameplay.\nAn example of the power of story in creating immersive experiences around gaming: the Runescape Party Hat - \u201cone of the most iconic items in the history of modern video games\u201d\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 2: Transactions and Payments\nBesides ownership of in-game assets, the ability to transact trustlessly on blockchain infrastructure could be a solution for problems that revolve around gray markets and RMT (Real Money Trading). As presented in \u201cInto the Void\u201d we assume RMT to be an inevitable byproduct of demand for in-game assets and build off that assumption.\nDistribute Margin\nThe CSGO skin trade is a multi-billion dollar market that lacks transparency despite its popularity, size, and efforts to regulate it. The market isn\u2019t the wild wild west anymore compared to pre-2018 thanks to greater oversight and regulation from Valve, but there still are plenty of fishy third-party sites that are made to scam unaware buyers.\n\nCSGOSkins\nA safer bet would be to trade on the Steam Marketplace, which is far more secure and popular. However, Steam Wallet has a limit of $2,000 (so all trades cannot exceed it), a hefty 15% fee, and money gained from trading MUST stay in the Steam ecosystem. If you want to cash out to fiat or have an item(s) worth more than $2000 to sell, you would need to head back to those aforementioned third-party sites. And while many do offer legitimate trading services, the more legitimate they are, the higher fees they tend to command and the greater the likelihood you will need to complete KYC verification and link your account with Steam. What we see is a centralization to Steam\u2019s marketplace and a select number of marketplaces that have high taxes and tactics to force you to stay in the Steam ecosystem.\nBecause blockchains already have developed infrastructure around secure transactions, marketplaces built atop public blockchains don\u2019t need as much capital investment to maintain security. Hence, they\u2019re able to distribute the margin they need to maintain profitability to the end-users, greatly lowering their take rate (marketplace fees on Opensea are 2.5%). Whereas in the past, Valve had to spend money validating transactions, responding to customer service requests, and building market infrastructure, public blockchains, and open source marketplace contracts already take care of all of these features (in fact just sell them on Opensea). Authenticity verification of NFTs is much easier via reading its metadata, restricting the possibility of scams by creating listing requirements on the platform.\nCrypto can also bring transparency to the RMT process. First, crypto-games by definition have adjacent marketplaces where buying and selling of in-game crypto assets take place. By accepting this as a feature of the game, the game can spin up its own marketplace and decrease player reliance on potentially fraudulent third-party websites. Second, through a listing mechanism where the product is automatically delivered upon receipt of payment, and/or through a DEX for in-game currency, crypto can enable better price discovery and trustless transactions.\nInterestingly, RMT sellers would also gain from adopting crypto. Current RMT sellers have to deal with credit card fraud, disputed charges, and merchant fees which take substantial chunks of their profits.\nDilution of Prestige\nA common criticism with embracing RMT is that it dilutes the amount of dedication a player put in to acquire a rare in-game asset if an RMTer could buy it at the click of a button. NFTs, via on-chain verifiable histories, make available to the public who it was that obtained (minted) the item. This can then act as social currency within the game.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 3: Interoperability\nBeyond the fact that the Smash Bros franchise is both a great party and competitive fighting game, we believe a factor in its immense success is how it allows characters from different franchises to interact. It\u2019s in people\u2019s nature to compare characters between different stories (Gandalf vs Dumbledore) and debate how a fight or interaction might shake out - to see it happen in-game satisfies that demand. People also find it fun when their favorite celebrities or fandoms collide and produce new content; scratching that \u2018what if\u2018 scenario in the back of our heads. But because of our current gaming infrastructure, the majority of games are siloed in their own franchises and aren\u2019t able to scratch that itch.\n\nA well-visited screen\nContent Interoperability\nGames like Smash Bros and Kingdom Hearts are in the minority. We believe that players are missing out on a whole new way to experience their games with closed-end ecosystems while developers are missing out on new ways to monetize and promote their games. Meanwhile, Fornite has realized this potential and is not afraid to take steps towards integrating other games/media outside of its universe, like the introduction of Kratos from the God of War franchise or John Wick as an example.\n\nFortnite\nNFTs can open the flood gates to interoperability between games. In so far as a game develops a representation of the NFT in their game, users will be able to integrate any NFT they desire. An NFT that represents a playable character or item in one game, could be a cosmetic skin or land in another. Not every NFT will need to be playable or have representation in-game (this is infeasible due to cost and game-design issues), but the fact that one in-game item can exist in another even just as a cosmetic piece can be powerful in terms of the partnerships and hype it can bring.\nBecause of the increased interoperability, players can also experience new ways to use the assets they own without needing to buy a new game. For example, if a Medieval MMORPG formed a partnership with a 5v5 NFT brawl game, the NFT character that I bought for the MMO could be used in the brawl game as well, effectively increasing my total playtime per item bought. Imagine the implications here for a game like Smash Bros.\nIt's exciting to see that these partnerships that will set the foundation of interoperability in NFT games are already being formed. Wararena and Iluvium\u2019s recent decision to form a partnership to solidify cross-compatibility is great, and we believe that the more games that are currently being developed with NFTs become interconnected, the sooner we can start building an open metaverse.\n\nEconomic Interoperability\nAfter converting cash into V-bucks (Fortnite) or Steam wallet dollars, there currently is no way to withdraw it back to fiat, nor send it to another platform (assuming 2 weeks have passed for Steam Wallet). This is an intentional and effective method to keep players invested in their platform/game and not move their purchasing power elsewhere. In the same article mentioned earlier, the lawsuit brought on by the French consumer protection group against Steam also argues that the inability for people to withdraw their money from Steam is anti-consumer behavior. Even with gift cards, one can redeem the remaining balance to fiat assuming some conditions are met.\nWe believe there are many other benefits that having an interchangeable currency can bring; for example:\nPlayers now actually have more control over their assets\nWithdraw to Fiat\nTransfer tokens to another player\nGames that use the same tokens as an in-game currency could experience a higher level of user growth since players would be more inclined to try out a new game (and pay for things in it) if they already have the underlying token to play it\nGame shutdowns won\u2019t wipe out in-game currency, and other games could use existing currencies in any way they see fit\nAll of this effectively increases the utility of my in-game crypto-currency\nOne can imagine, once the Axie SDK is open source, new Axie game modes will create more use cases for SLP and increase Axie demand.\nAt the end of the day, the current system works, albeit in a non-ideal way. People are aware of the irreversibility of putting cash into their Steam wallet, and they still do it anyway. We just believe that there are more consumer and game-studio-friendly alternatives available with crypto.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 4: Game Governance\nI vividly remember opening up another tab on Internet Explorer to furtively chop willows or AFK salmon during computer class. This was 15 years ago, and I still play today.\n\nAnd no I am not maxed...\nNostalgia\nThe golden age of Runescape was RS2 pre-EOC/post wildy + free trade. (For a quick recap, RS1 had old-school graphics and limited content, RS2 had an expansion of new skills, quests, and a deeper storyline, while RS3 had a new combat mechanic (EOC) and pay-to-win micropayments that caused a community schism.)  As with most games, simply by having existed long enough the dev team ended up shipping updates that were not well received by most of the community.\nPost EOC (in RS3) there was such a large exodus of players that the CEO of Jagex (the developing company behind the game) put out a community poll, a means to previously gauge player interest around updates, to determine whether Jagex should create a retro version of the game. If it received more than 50,000 votes the retro 2007 servers would be revived, and for each additional 250,000 votes it received, this \u201cfork\u201d would receive extra benefits and attention from the team.\nHere\u2019s an in-depth explanation of the fork:\nThe poll proceeded to pass with 440,000 votes spawning the creation of the now more popular OSRS (old school Runescape). As one of the promised benefits at the level of interest they received, the mods created an in-game polling system, where only paying members who had a total level above 300 and more than 25 hours of game-time would be able to vote on significant updates, new quests, cosmetics, and items. Only if the vote passed with more than 75% yes votes would the updates be implemented in-game. These polls are detailed, giving users the leeway to vote on the creation of new game modes, cosmetics, and different stats a game item possesses.\n\nPoll Booth\nThough widely supported by the community, this rollback also erased 6 years\u2019 worth of content from 2007-2013. Today I would give anything to be able to go back to 2008 and finish \u201cWhile Guthix Sleeps\u201d on my original RS account, but alas the quest is now part of RS3, and my new OSRS character no longer has access to the quests I dreamt of completing in my childhood.\nThe Overarching Issue\nAll of these aforementioned issues stemmed from unilateral updates that the devs shipped without community input. We were members of a game without any say in how it progressed despite having sunk our time, money, and soul into it. Despite our willingness to do so, there was no way for users to contribute to further game development post-roll-back - to restore our favorite quests, or decide on which year to roll back the servers to.\nI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit. - Vitalik Buterin\nBut, at the end of the day, none of this is the core dev teams\u2019 fault. They are under a catch-22 pressure, where unless there are new updates and content, players leave for newer pastures; but if there are too many updates, players grumble about balance and ruining the game. It is in their incentive structure to continue to ship updates at break-neck speeds. That is until one of the updates ends up as unpopular as EOC.\nAnd why restore to the 2007 version? - that was the only version that they could find that was backed up in the company hard drive.\nIssues with the Rollback / Voting System\nBy requiring that any update pass a plurality vote, OSRS gives the community the power to decide on how the game will progress. The polling system is by design conservative, making it unlikely that any large system altering update (like EOC) gets passed without scrutiny, and though voter participation is low, issues of particular interest (Group Ironman, adding new skills) do get much higher turnout than other polls (10% of player base or 2x DAU).\nAt the very least this can stop the degeneration of the game into an unrecognizable hodge-podge of overlapping updates. On the other hand, the plurality requirement and low voter turnout pit opinionated conservationists against people that want to see further developments in OSRS.\nThis opinionated minority effectively has the power to block all new updates that greatly alter the game. This puts people like me who valued RS2 in an odd position. We weren\u2019t around to feel nostalgic and maximalist about preserving the classic nature of 2007 Runescape, yet we are also unwilling to go WoW in neighboring RS3. We want, and to this day fight for, a dynamically moving OSRS with our favorite quests, new items, and skills. Yet each successive time there is a vote to alter the 75% plurality requirement or updates that meaningfully alter the game, they are struck down by the minority.\nAn example of this conservative blocking power was in the failure of a new skill warding to pass the polls. Read about it briefly here. It failed with a yes vote of 66%, showing that a plurality requirement can create a static game.\nAnother disadvantage of the OSRS voting model is that it is prone to bot attacks (Sybil attacks). It\u2019s easy for bots to create new accounts, and without detection, achieve 25 hours of gameplay plus a total level of 300. Though the ease of doing so decreases exponentially per hour played, (for example if the % likelihood of getting banned per hour of botting gameplay is 0.1%, then there is a 10% chance of getting banned in the first 100 hours) with current bot detection systems, it is more than likely that they can form a voting bloc that casts the deciding vote.\nRight now there is little incentive for RMTers and bot farmers to actively participate in the polls as most of the ballot items do not impact botting income, but if governance decisions had a direct impact on the price of associated tokens and items in-game then bot attacks become very costly.\n\nA bot farm in the wildy\nFinally, the OSRS model has no formal way for players to originate ideas. It has happened before that a popular forum post, filtered and edited by the devs, landed on a poll, but this is a rare occurrence.\nAre NFT games able to Solve these problems?\nFrankly, we\u2019re not", "doc_id": "dc43ab29-ffea-4ac8-a76f-6b8782a1b7c0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "443e86c07a37965ff12af67f063177250d50736534e1b067f348e2fe2f4bc154", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 195044, "end": 210584}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "e37cd58d-15c7-4805-8ac1-51e9da7824fc", "3": "b77494d9-9138-4e64-8d5e-0f6150fb86d8"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b77494d9-9138-4e64-8d5e-0f6150fb86d8": {"text": "a 10% chance of getting banned in the first 100 hours) with current bot detection systems, it is more than likely that they can form a voting bloc that casts the deciding vote.\nRight now there is little incentive for RMTers and bot farmers to actively participate in the polls as most of the ballot items do not impact botting income, but if governance decisions had a direct impact on the price of associated tokens and items in-game then bot attacks become very costly.\n\nA bot farm in the wildy\nFinally, the OSRS model has no formal way for players to originate ideas. It has happened before that a popular forum post, filtered and edited by the devs, landed on a poll, but this is a rare occurrence.\nAre NFT games able to Solve these problems?\nFrankly, we\u2019re not sure! But we at least believe that the opportunity set of possible experiments is so vast that somewhere we will be able to find solutions to mitigate, if not solve these issues.\nThe pressure to constantly update will still exist but can be organically dissipated by community-driven content and decentralized governance. The exact version of the game the community desires can be retrieved at all times and run by any member that desires to do so, and more sophisticated polling systems than the one used by OSRS can be used/experimented with to target specific results.\nDecentralized Governance\nFor a quick overview of what blockchain governance is check out this link. For a more in-depth introduction, we suggest the Crypto Canon: Governance section.\nA reductive explanation would be that crypto-based communities, often organized around a particular project with its own token, are operated by governance systems where instead of a singular centralized entity making decisions (in this example think Jagex unilaterally pushing updates) there exists some form of voting or social consensus system among its users, community members and token holders. Within predefined bounds, changes to the protocol/application must pass a vote. Think about how in OSRS players that meet a certain threshold can vote for proposals that directly affect the game.\nDeGov Unique to Crypto Games\nGaming, in particular, gives us access to primitives that allow the creation of new crypto-governance models. We hope to propose a rough blueprint of such a model that addresses issues within gaming and existing crypto-governance using unique qualities only available in games.\nExisting Issues with Crypto-Governance\nThe predominant crypto-governance model is some form of coin-voting. Those who possess tokens can cast or delegate votes which are then weighed depending on the protocol\u2019s governance specifications. Coin governance is prone to bribing, plutocracy and must implement additional measures to safeguard itself from predatory financial interests - quadratic voting being a prime example. It also fails to represent interests besides token holders. For a comprehensive overview check out Vitalik\u2019s blog post - Beyond Coin Governance.\nAs mentioned in his article, a solution to the issues of coin-voting is non-coin-driven governance of which one branch - that doesn\u2019t involve KYC - is \u201cproof of participation\u201d.\nProof of participation: systems that attest to the fact that some account corresponds to a person that has participated in some event, passed some educational training, or performed some useful work in the ecosystem. See POAP for one attempt to implement thus. - Vitalik\nIn existing protocols tangibly measuring proof of participation is a challenging issue. However, within a game, there are easily provable ways of verifying participation and subsequently weighing this participation.\nProof of Participation Voting Mechanisms\nOne immediate metric we can take as a proxy to participation is the total level of a character.\nFor instance, we could easily envision an extension of the OSRS model, where only members who have played more than X hours and have met certain leveling conditions get to vote and propose new items on the ballot.\nBut from there we could extend the voting mechanism with ideas brought over from coin-voting. The number of votes delegated to a user per voting round could scale at:\n                         (X-S)^n\n\nwhere x is the on-chain verifiable level, s is a phase shift that guarantees adequate Sybil resistance, and n is some constant (or piecewise changing), whereby the more total levels you have the more votes you earn, rewarding established players who verifiably have put time and effort into the game over newer users. With this simple model, we\u2019ve engaged in a tradeoff between Sybil resistance in voting and plutocracy. However for an optimized s and n, given a high enough % chance of being banned per time botted, we could minimize the effects of bot-attacks that sway key governance decisions, or at the very least cause it to be temporally infeasible for bot accounts to overcome actual user\u2019s decisions. The disadvantages of such a model would be that it could establish a gerontocracy as voting power pools in existing players which would incentivize account selling.  (Similar to this proof of playtime model is YGG\u2019s token distribution model, where governance tokens are distributed to those who complete quests and contribute more to the community. We do not yet know how they will measure, verify contribution or decide on the number of rewards issued upon completion of those quests. Check their whitepaper here.)\nSolving Gerontocracy\nTo prevent gerontocracy we could implement a voting power decay. Taking Runescape as an example for clarity, it could be that the first season of voting after you achieve 2000 total levels you receive x amount of votes, but every subsequent year x decays at a slow linear rate, removing the power of long-time incumbents and benefiting relatively newer users as they gain more experience. This is of course offset as the older players further advance within the game and earn more voting power through achieving new milestones. Once you reach the level limit this decay could stop, rewarding the highest achieving players.\n\nAn example of how voting power could scale with time\nAccount Buying\nAs for large-scale account buying, we could implement the solution adopted by Axie Infinity. Because each character is an NFT with on-chain levels, we could easily have the level reset upon any transfer. (Axie progress resets upon each account transfer).\n\nConsequence for Transfering\nAnother solution would be to make the NFT representing your playable account non-transferable. This would equate large-scale account buying to large-scale purchasing of private keys - entailing its own security and coordination costs. Because private keys are also unalterable, the seller can still access the account post-sale, further discouraging large-scale account buying. (We are currently working on an optimized version of the above model, testing different parameters to maximize Sybil resistance. Catch us in another post soon!)\nCoin Voting + Proof of Playtime\nHaving established a proof-of-playtime voting system, we can combine it with existing coin-voting to give representation to overlapping but different constituencies. The weighing of these two votes could be ossified to outline the key governance values of the game. One can imagine a scenario where coin holders represent \u2153 of the voting power while proof of playtime voters control the rest, leading to the ability of coin-voters to sway important decisions, but not be the deciding factor in altering the game that the players invest their money, time and soul into.\nWhy not Off-chain?\nOne of the key reasons decentralized voting becomes necessary is that there can be times when the dev team (if there is a centralized team developing the game) and the community are in opposition to one another. With current games, besides the occasional dissatisfaction with an update, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. The community is the main source of revenue for the dev team, and alienating too many can come at the cost of their livelihood.\nHowever, one can imagine a blockchain game where the assets and tokens associated with it have become so valuable that despite the community\u2019s desire in changing gameplay, it is in the best interest of the devs to preserve the value of their initial allocation over anything else.\nIf a governing proposal benefits the players at the expense of the token price, then a vote where correct execution is guaranteed and the votes and outcome cannot be tampered with by the team, is important.\nThough not immediately congruent, we can take a look at Axie Infinity, where the majority of scholar-players want some form of an Axie sink and higher SLP breeding requirements to raise the price of SLP, while it is in the team\u2019s best interest to only marginally maintain acceptable yields and breeding profitability to increase the size of their player base.\nIlluvium Improvement Proposal-4: A Case Study\nIlluvium is a current work-in-progress game that is positioning itself as the first AAA game to be built on IMX on Ethereum. It\u2019s an open-world RPG, where players collect creatures (Illuvials) and use them to battle other players in an Auto-Chess game mode. This game is the first of its dev-size and popularity in the crypto space that has already implemented some form of decentralized governance. ILV holders get to vote for representatives on the Illuvium Council and delegate their vote to the person of their choice. Council members can then debate and vote on proposals submitted by token holders such as but not limited to:\nBalance Changes\nExpansion Packs\nCharacter Sets\nMonster Spawn Rates\nMarketplace Fees\nAnd there are already early signs that the system can generate good results. A proposal was successfully passed to disallow locked tokens belonging to seed investors to qualify for staking rewards.\nThis change was to \u201csubstantially increase the APY of both pools, which will incentivize new users to purchase and stake ILV\u201d and remove possibilities of \u201cpotentially harming the decentralization of the project\u201d (the whole proposal). This change was enacted to avoid plutocracy as stakers with locked tokens could also generate more ILV from yield farming, which would centralize their holdings and push smaller stakers and farmers out of the loop.\nThe passing of this proposal shows that the DAO can sacrifice short-term benefits for long-term objectives. It\u2019s even more significant since it had a substantial (short-term) financial impact on the founding and then-current holders ILV, and the fact it reneged on some promises made to seed investors. It was a win for the longevity of the game, and I think the meteoric rise in the price of ILV since April somewhat reflects that.\nI reached out to the person who suggested the change, and here is what he had to say:\n\nOur Conversation on Discord\nSo is it all worth it?\nShould the core community of players and stakeholders in a game be able to self-govern (self-originated ideas, vote) in a way that is less susceptible to bot attacks (than existing game governance) and plutocracy (than coin-voting) via implementing a proof of play-time mechanism?  Frankly, we\u2019re not sure. We still don\u2019t know if the mechanism can achieve adequate Sybil resistance, and how to implement a decentralized bot-banner.\nBut as we were writing this article, Riot Games\u2019 unanimous decision to remove the /all chat (RIP 2009-2021) in patch 11.21 without ANY sort of warning to or consulting of the player base demonstrates the one-sided development of games. From general discussions, it seems while most people believe Riot came with good intentions, they have focused their energy entirely in the wrong place and are out of touch. Many believe that Riot should be focused on developing better software and features that detect the consistent bad actors (repeat AFKers, Trollers, Heavy Profanity Users, etc.) and implement more appropriate punishments accordingly while rewarding good behavior.\nWhile I\u2019m sure making a comprehensive judicial system for the world\u2019s most popular game isn\u2019t easy, I also think the amount of time they\u2019ve had surely would have been enough to come up with something better. In a decentralized system, I think players would have voted for the implementation of a better judicial system and malicious-behavior detection software a long time ago, and Riot games would have had to implement it, or at least not pull this nonsense of banning the beloved /all chat that solves basically nothing.\n\nEDIT: Seems like Riot has heard the crowd (thankfully) last minute, the ban is now limited to certain regions with a 2 patch duration to test the efficacy of the ban\nThere are large tradeoffs to community governance and a game controlled by its users may end up shipping developments at the whim of its community that ends up ruining the long-term prospects of the game anyways. But at the end of the day\n\u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government \u2013 except for all the others that have been tried.\u201d\nThis form of game development may be less fluid and tend toward conservatism, but it may turn out better than the benevolent dictatorship of a core dev team. At the very least we believe that given our history it is an experiment worth trying.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 5: Reward Contributors\nReward Gamers/Content Creators\nOne of the core advantages of having a coin is that the protocol has a native currency to reward constituencies and contributors in such a way that their incentives are aligned with the success of the protocol itself. Earlier contributors obtain these rewards at a lower cost basis and take on a larger risk in participating in an unproven ecosystem. The efforts they expend to grow bring in later participants, and the price of their tokens now appreciates to reflect the increased interest in the project.\nThis is the system implemented by Axie Infinity. Every season, the 1000 highest ranked players are eligible to claim progressively higher AXS rewards. The highest-ranked player for season 17 earned 225 AXS, which at the time of this writing is valued at 31,000USD. This creates a feedback loop where players increasingly strive to achieve higher rankings, thus experimenting with new builds, breeding, creating guides, making videos, teaching scholars...etc overall growing the ecosystem through monetary interest, all the while rewarding its most avid players, streamers and contributors.\n\nLeaderboard Rewards\nReward Developers/Modders/Marketers\nIf a game is fully decentralized without a developing company behind it, who will maintain the game, run customer service, work on new projects, find new partnerships...etc?\nIn lieu of the length of the article so far and because we believe that the possible implementations of this are not unique to games, we will not touch upon it here. We suggest the following readings:\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html (specifically check out futarchy)\nhttps://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c, https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html, or to check out index-coop DAO\u2019s contributor compensation process (thought at the moment it is centralized)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 6: Opensource\nOne protection that blockchain games provide against bad governance is the ability to return the game to any specific snapshot in time.\nBlockchain games have publicly available contracts which run their game logic. Many games have not only published public GitHub Repos with", "doc_id": "b77494d9-9138-4e64-8d5e-0f6150fb86d8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "47ce33fcde0256f2e31e8d6d0175862be48e47301954c936fcf69c005165c535", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 210601, "end": 226251}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "dc43ab29-ffea-4ac8-a76f-6b8782a1b7c0", "3": "6f17e568-a26d-4dab-b294-f9f326f673fa"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f17e568-a26d-4dab-b294-f9f326f673fa": {"text": "We suggest the following readings:\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html (specifically check out futarchy)\nhttps://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c, https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html, or to check out index-coop DAO\u2019s contributor compensation process (thought at the moment it is centralized)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPillar 6: Opensource\nOne protection that blockchain games provide against bad governance is the ability to return the game to any specific snapshot in time.\nBlockchain games have publicly available contracts which run their game logic. Many games have not only published public GitHub Repos with their smart contracts, but they\u2019ve also open-sourced the Unity client of the game, including the interface and graphical resources (an example).\nThus anyone can aggregate this data, decide on a specific period of time when they want to revert the game back to and alter the logic of the contracts and game assets such that it replicates a specific moment in time, then deploy this new version of the game (though at the moment at non-negligible costs). Item and token balances would not be able to be returned unless the blockchain itself is forked, but at the very least, the game would start over OSRS style. Nine Chronicles is an example of an open-source blockchain game.\n\nBy being easy to fork, blockchain games achieve ease of exit, a core tenet of good governance. Any decisions contrary to the wishes of the community that are implemented via plutocratic interest or bot-attacks are reversible, though not at a negligible cost.\nFlourishing Parallel Worlds\nCrypto + open source games have implications beyond governance. Modded versions of games have always been at the forefront of pushing gameplay to new frontiers and genres. In fact, some of the most popular games of all time were inspired or directly created in/as mods of other games. From user-created modes, maps to user-created in-game assets, mods defined and created many of the games we know and love today.\nBut mods today though suffer from increased centralization as they become more popular. As they become more popular, they often get absorbed by the original game creator. Because many of these open-source/modded games are usually not profitable and maintained by people as a side hobby or an experiment, to sustain them, this happens more often than not (Minecraft is a prominent counter-example).\nBecause of the previously discussed ways that blockchain can prove ownership and generate continued revenue through royalty implementations, it is possible to have an open-source game that is also able to generate continuous revenue through the sale of in-game assets for the original creator AND the modders. The modders can also be rewarded through mechanisms detailed in pillar 5.\nA good example where open-sourced blockchain development could have benefited a game is the development of DayZ.\nTLDR: DayZ was first a mod developed by an Arma 2 player. The modder took the best aspects of Arma 2 and transformed it into a survival game with zombies which became playable on an Arma 2 server. Soon there were spin-off servers that layered more mods on top of the OG DayZ mod that offered vastly different gameplay mechanics and features (PVP focused, base building, etc.) than other servers. Players naturally gravitated to the servers that contained the gameplay they liked.\nThen, Bohemia Interactive decided it wanted to cash in on this opportunity, so it brought in the creator of the first DayZ mod and developers from their Arma 2 team to create a stand-alone, official DayZ game. Unfortunately, the new team unilaterally decided on features that should be in the official game without even considering the different player types across the servers, which alienated most of the PVP and base building lovers. The game itself turned out to be a buggy mess, and full of features that players did not ask for.\nBy ignoring the different player groups that existed in the different servers as the dev team began creating the standalone, it left a vacuum that games like PUBG (Player Unknown developed a battle royale server for DayZ which was his claim to fame), Rust, and Subnautica satisfied the desire these left-over players had, which blossomed into multibillion-dollar games across new genres.\n\nThe predecessor of PUBG started as a mod of Arma 2 (Credits to HandsomeJayce on Youtube)\nSo how and why could blockchain development benefit the development of DayZ in this scenario? Imagine a parallel universe, where Bohemia Interactive didn\u2019t make the unilateral choices they did (think governance again), and instead from day 1 started by providing open-source tools and assets to scale those different servers. Through NFTs, they could have generated revenue from those assets as modders utilized or sold them in their own servers. Letting those modded DayZ servers thrive and grow while continuing to provide backend support and tools would have been a much safer route to take while still financially benefiting from ecosystem expansion. And DayZ could have survived the innovator\u2019s dilemma by seeding promising mods without ruining its potential.\nRedefining the Future of Work?\nI am not an economist, official or self-proclaimed. The claims I make in this section are based on reasoning alone without a background in the existing literature. If there are well-established empirical studies that support or refute these claims please send them my way! That being said I hope you have some leniency if I throw around terms without much rigor.\nWages\nIt seems intuitive, and I seem to recall from freshman year macroeconomics, that in a perfectly competitive world, labor market equilibrium happens when the marginal benefit from hiring another worker is equal to the wage rate. Put another way, under perfect competition in the labor market, wages for the new employee will be equal to how much value he/she can generate for the firm.\nOf course in the real world, nothing is perfectly competitive and there are (for some people) massive switching costs to jobs, informational asymmetry, differing market conditions, and rent-seeking behavior by corporations who use a combination of these tactics to offer lower wages than the value each worker creates. One can imagine a setting where there is an excess supply of unemployed workers, a lack of union protection, high-living costs resulting in switching costs, and general abuse of informational asymmetry - offering lower than market-rate wages, altering benefits...etc - resulting in lower wages than at theoretical equilibrium. The aggregate value produced via labor is thus captured by the firm instead of being distributed to the employee.\nThis often means that the world\u2019s least connected, least educated that live in the least protected geographies with the poorest economies suffer the most from these asymmetries. But note that these conditions can happen anywhere in the world.\nDoes Crypto Gaming Help?\nWe often hear about how crypto gaming will redefine work itself - this is the fundamental mission of YGG. Gabby Dizon, CEO of YGG, posits that the question people of the future will ask is whether it's more fun to make money playing a game than it is to be an Uber driver or a construction worker - that the employment choice of the future will be between gig work and metaverse work. But this question only holds under assumptions that value created by contributors can be fully captured, or more wholly captured by the contributors themselves. If such asymmetries as mentioned above exist, then crypto gaming is just another instance of gig work outsourced to those with the least opportunities to allow value accrual to large capital holders (scholarship managers, guilds...etc).\nSo\u2026 Can it? Aka. How Crypto Changes this Equation\nTrustlessness\nFrom Pillar 2, we understand that RMT markets are opaque and have bad UX for buyers of in-game assets, but the introduction of crypto can allow users to transact trustlessly. This is one of the key pieces in redefining the future of work.\nBecause this is a grey market, scams abound and the discomfort of entering in your credit card data without assurance that your gold will be delivered is nerve-racking, the sellers who have the most/best positive ratings dominate purchases. This means that sellers who have the capital to deploy customer service, marketing bots on forums/in-game, set up and host custom websites...etc will end up attracting more customers, which reflexively attracts more customers, regardless of price. This incentivizes the creation of larger pools that expand this initial capital to gain size, then raise prices. Once you have built enough trust and legitimacy such that it makes sense to use your platform over cheaper alternatives, it's very hard for new entrants to unseat existing sellers.\nCrypto levels this playing field. Once you know that each vendor is trustworthy (by definition of the blockchain), then it is in the buyers\u2019 best interest to purchase from the pool with the best price, or the most benefits. As for the sellers, any seller is now able to plug into the marketplace without the upfront investment of scaling legitimacy. And because the marketplace platforms themselves are again easy to create, producer income can scale linearly with production. The margin that accrued to those at scale and to the platform is now distributed to everyone.\nRewarding Time and Effort\nIf there is demand for in-game assets and gold, and RMT platforms exist where they can be changed for fiat, the production of in-game assets and gold is valuable labor denominated in fiat. But even one step further, crypto allows the rewarding of in-game contributions outside of the simple production of in-game assets.\nIn the past you contributed your time and soul to a game, amassing items that are then circulated into the economy. You build guilds, interact with other players and build social credibility within the game. With the introduction of crypto-gaming, it has become possible to reward and incentivize these players and core contributors in a way that is fair and algorithmic. As introduced in Pillar 5, gamers can be incentivized by levels, times, or core contributions as voted retroactively by members of the community.\nCertainly, Zezima and Woox contributed to the popularity of Runescape as much as many of the mods at Jagex, and Dean Hall did the same for Arma 2 with DayZ.\nGeography\nFinally, crypto gaming is global. Most often when we produce goods and services, we are selling them to the purchasing power of our immediate vicinity or the section of the supply chain that is within our immediate vicinity. The farmer, clothes maker, bank teller of a specific region are henceforth bound in their wages by the economic conditions of the region they live in, so that the demand for their goods and services, either by the end-user or the next step in the supply chain, come from local buyers. This means that those who live in countries with economic instability have commensurate low wages.\nThis is true even in software. Despite software\u2019s global nature, in practice at a smaller scale, local firms use local technologies. This is why despite being an SWE, some of my Axie scholars tell me they make as much if not more playing Axie than coding.\nWith crypto gaming, however, any worker anywhere can tap into a global source of demand. Games have been global from day 1. Because markets built on crypto are also fundamentally global, assets produced in-game that are then sold to those who want to play the game, are matched with the highest price. This purchasing power then leads to higher wages and empowerment of the aforementioned regions via capital inflow from more economically developed regions. This is why Axie scholars can sometimes earn more than their yearly wage playing Axie Infinity, or why they\u2019re able to buy houses, laundry machines from Axie earnings. This is also why Venezuelan gold farmers exist on WoW and OSRS.\nCombined with the fact that transparent markets allow sustainable earnings for smaller players and redistribute margin from larger pools and platforms to smaller users, crypto gaming will allow any individual to play a game and sell the byproduct of their gaming to a global market. Furthermore, they will be able to get compensated by the depth of their contributions regardless of their geography.\nWarning: Over Financialization\nWhile we illustrated an ambitious vision for how blockchain games can benefit gaming, we also acknowledge the overwhelming response from the gaming community that does not want financialization in their games.\nAt the end of the day, games are meant to be fun. Though you may derive auxiliary revenue from playing, if the purpose of the game becomes to make money, or if large financial interests come in and speculate on prices of rare items and land thus pricing out players, then gameplay becomes exclusionary to the players themselves. This is why it\u2019s so important to maintain decentralized player-driven governance over coin-voting schemes in NFT games.\nOverall, we warn against games seeking to maximally price discriminate through NFT licenses, NFT items...etc, and any cash-grab projects that add no value. We hope that games can still maintain their end goal of providing a fun time for the user while using NFTs, governance, and contributor rewards to enhance games\u2019 functionality and ability to tell a narrative, thus creating a more immersive and positive gaming experience.\nThe Future\nStory + Value + Virtual worlds. Games have the opportunity to become the backdrop of what is being called the metaverse - as defined by Mathew Ball:\n\u201cA massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.\u201d\nFortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox have demonstrated they have surpassed use cases beyond just gaming and dub sub-games within their platforms as experiences. As the games evolve, so will our involvement within their worlds.\n\nThe Canonical Example - Travis Scott Convert In Fornite\nWe hope that these experiences will be able to take advantage of the aforementioned pillars of crypto-gaming while avoiding over-finalization to provide more immersive, open, and fair experiences in whatever this may evolve into in the next 20 years.\nIn our next article, we will introduce protocols building economic primitives in the metaverse. We are also working on a paper on optimized proof of participation models based on on-chain verifiable participation data in crypto games.

This is not something that can be covered in a single blog post so I will breakdown some of my thoughts around it throughout a series of blogs, this is part 001 and my opinions could change over time so I may re-address things in the future.\nFirst: what are tokenomics?\nPut very simply it is the economy revolving around a token, or cryptocurrency.\nSo, when we talk about tokenomics we are generally talking about supply and demand which involves issuance, value or use cases, and burn mechanisms.\nToday I only want to focus on burn mechanisms and specifically in games.\nWeb2 games today generally have tokens but they are honeypots (meaning you can buy but you cannot sell) so there isn\u2019t a large concern with having well-rounded burn mechanisms for a variety of gamers. Due to that fact, burn mechanisms have not been as important previously in games but they have been looked at before just not at the extent which will be required for web3 games. It is also extremely important when designing an in-game economy that will be subject to external forces, many of which can be used to disrupt said economy and will if allowed to do so but we will leave that for another post.\nBurn Mechanisms\nBurn mechanisms (can also be referred to as token sinks) \u2014 tend to drive the majority of the value/use cases for tokens in-game. You need to burn the token to receive something else in return, the task at hand is incentivizing the entire player base to burn the token instead of selling it which can be difficult when said token could drive a decent price.\nThis is inherently difficult because not everyone is the same, so they spend differently and for different reasons. For example, an extrovert will enjoy time spent at a bar more than an introvert will and an introvert will enjoy their time spent reading a book in isolation more than the other. It is a tad more complex than this but it is a great example to set the tone.\nAnother way to look at things was captured perfectly by this tweet from Tin Nguyen who is building Sipher:\n\nDifferent types of players are looking for different experiences.\nYou can see there are several gamer archetypes highlighted \u2014 all of them will approach the game and their spending differently. This isn\u2019t unique to games, in fact here is a summary of this scientific journal that discusses how personality can be derived from spending habits in general.\nAnd another from Yale\nLet\u2019s talk about personality-based burn mechanisms\nWe can start with what we have seen gamers spend money on to date:\nClout\nSkins, wraps, collectibles/rare items, expressive experiences [Expressionist/Treasure hunter]\nSocial\nOnline play, multiplayer experiences, access to groups (FWB), raiding [networker]\nAdvantages\nconsumables, boosters, improved sights, aim-bots [King of the hill/Skill Master]\nFinancial\nAdditional assets, easier access to assets, higher value assets [Treasure Hunter]\nExperiences\nasset variation, character variation, game enhancements, enjoyment, mods [Strategist/Thrill seeker/Skill master]\nTime\nsaving time, buying pre-leveled accounts, WoW mounts to travel faster [King of the hill]\nSo when we think about incentivizing burn mechanisms to drive demand to the tokens we should ensure we provide value for a wide variety of personalities. This seems to not be as widely spoken about in this space as p2e has been extremely financially motivated in the past and most burn mechanisms were financially incentivized or for an \u2018expressionist\u2019, i.e. skins, collectibles, or to sell. I am not saying a game\u2019s tokenomics will only be successful if they incorporate all of these burn mechanisms into their game but I think being well-rounded will be more important for broader enjoyment of the game & its long-term success.\nBurn mechanisms should fall into as many of these buckets as possible to incentive different players & personality types to spend money with the expectation of one of the above rewards in return. This is how you align gamers by rewarding them with something of value that is not directly monetary and how play & earn replaces play to earn. I may have also left some other examples of personality spends out so feel free to tweet at me if you have additional ideas!\nHere\u2019s another great read on the topic by \nTerry Chung\nI want to put $10 in and get $3 out but also have fun doing it. That\u2019s the future of web3 gaming.\nP.S. I see myself as a thrill seeker mixed with strategist & sometimes king of the hill.\nGaming\nWeb3\nTokenomics\nPlaytoearn\nCryptocurrency\n100\n1\n\nWritten by Richard Cabrera\n74 Followers\nCo-Founder of Ready Player DAO, Founder of Ready Scholar\n\n\n\n\u2014---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPlay to earn economies as base layer protocols for games\nThe biggest P2E ecosystems will be community first.\n\n\nPeter \u2018pet3rpan\u2019\n\n\u00b7\nFollow\n\u00b7\n888\n7\nPlayer retention in gaming is everything.\nDespite this, publishers optimize for company profit at the cost of player value and well-being. They are able to do this due to their end-to-end ownership and control over the development, distribution, and management of games. A prime example of this is Electronic Arts (EA), a game publisher that has gained a villain-like role in the gaming community due to their prioritization of their own microtransaction monetization models over the player experience.\nIn 2017, EA released Star Wars BattleFront 2 where players either had to play 40 hours to unlock a single character such as Dark Vader or instead pay for it. The company\u2019s response to the backlash is the most downvoted Reddit comment in history, highlighting the hostile publisher-gamer dynamics:\nWith approximately 30% of the company\u2019s overall revenue coming solely from FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) loot-box style item sales, leaked company documents demonstrate the company\u2019s priority to capture microtransaction activity: EA claims that \u201cAll roads lead to FUT\u201d as \u201cFUT is the cornerstone and we are doing everything we can to drive players there.\u201d\n\nEA\u2019s response on reddit \u2014 the most downvoted comment in Reddit history\nThe core vision behind play to earn (P2E) is to address these issues by offering real player ownership of in-game assets and their surrounding world, ultimately creating greater stickiness and retention of communities. In contrast to the current global 30-day retention rate of 3% of mobile games, we have seen some initial success with the first prominent P2E ecosystem: Axie Infinity \u2014 which has a D0-D90retention rate of 40%.\nEdit: Not everyone who downloaded Axie Infinity was able to play, hence the actual D1-D90 retention rate is approximately much higher than 40%.\nThe problem with Web 2.5 Games\nAs a result of Axie Infinity\u2019s success, we\u2019ve seen a surge of new P2E ecosystems attempting to replicate similar success. Despite this, many of the projects still aim to centrally control and coordinate the end-to-end production of games \u2014 thus potentially replicating the same structural mis-alignments found in legacy games.\nThese Web 2.5 games look to leverage \u2018crypto as a feature\u2019 by enabling digital asset ownership via NFTs or financial ownership of an economy via ERC-20s, but at the same time aim to limit context and participation around other more cryptonative properties of ownership, such as governance. Typically, the teams behind Web 2.5 games look to build highly polished but closed ecosystems where the entire player experience is centrally controlled by a single organization. These projects consider themselves \u2018game first\u2019 and mostly still optimize for Web 2 growth metrics, arguably under the same value extractive mentality as those of legacy game publishers.\n\u201cWe are implementing NFTs as we think it will generate more revenue. We believe that players are willing to spend more if they believe those assets will go up in value.\u201d\n\u2014 Game Studio [Name undisclosed]\nAnalogous with CeDeFi, these games look to build closed-loop, centrally-controlled ecosystems on top of inherently open and permissionless crypto networks.\nWhile we don\u2019t expect all P2E ecosystems to be decentralized from the start, anticipating a more gradual process of decentralization as seen with Axie Infinity, we believe this Web 2.5 trend of game development stems from a fundamentally incomplete understanding of composability, interoperability, and the power of decentralized coordination technologies.\nOur thesis\nWe believe that Web 3 games will win over Web 2 and Web 2.5 games because they leverage community ownership, real economic value, and native composability to drive greater player adoption & retention. We believe that the Web 2.5 approach to building P2E ecosystems is not enough to prevent the value extraction of communities. This is because there would still be key reliance on a single coordinating party that owns the end-to-end development and management of the economy and end player experiences. Instead, we believe we need to treat P2E ecosystems as open source public goods where all aspects of the economy and surrounding play experiences are built out in the open.\nThe verifiability of the system establishes trust that the system undeniably does what it says it does, and the consensus of participants about the information in the database establishes an unquestionable truth.\n\u2014 1kx\u2019s Token Maximalist Thesis\nThrough token incentives and community ownership, we are able to unbundle the role of a publisher through a bottom-up set of contributors, players, and guilds which instead drive worldbuilding, product development, and governance. By bringing these responsibilities out into the open, we are no longer dependent on a single company to achieve the goals of the entire ecosystem but can leverage open-source contributions from anyone on the internet.\nInstead of thinking about P2E as standalone games or \u2018apps\u2019, we believe P2E ecosystems are about building self-sustaining virtual nation state economies that community members can trust, collectively operate, own and build on top of.\n\nPlay to earn economies as virtually governed nation states\nDue to the live economics at play, the P2E dynamics surrounding games take on a whole new level of importance. These economies are not only just places where community members play, but also worlds in which they have financial upside, ownership over revenue generating businesses & valuable digital assets, and defined jobs & responsibilities.\nWe can think of P2E economies as virtual nation states. Its citizens will want to live in the most democratically well run country with the best opportunities for them (fun, work, social, culture). For these virtual economies to retain its community members, they must fairly and transparently make decisions that have serious economic implications to their citizens such as:\nEconomic policies: eg. In-game asset supply, balancing mechanisms\nMonetization: eg. value accrual mechanisms, transaction fees\nTreasury: eg. What community initiatives should be funded?\nIP: eg. How should the intellectual property of the ecosystem be licensed?\nRather than pure user growth, we believe community-run P2E economies will optimize for functional governance, the \u2018quality of life\u2019 for their community members, \u2018GDP\u2019, and economic stability. And in turn, by making decisions better aligned with the interests of their community members, they\u2019ll not only retain but attract better community members by providing a safely managed economy to rely on (Public Goods & the Protocol Sink Thesis). The virtual nation-state analogy becomes ever more real as we increasingly spend more time in virtual spaces and are able to take our identity, friends, and assets with us as we move from world to world.\n\nPlay to earn economies as community distribution platforms for an open-source ecosystem of builders and creators\nUnlike Web 2 games where data is siloed by centralized databases, P2E economies can act as open, interoperable SDK-like platforms upon which contributors can build in a permissionless manner. This enables us to treat the economy as a base layer protocol for other community-generated games and experiences to emerge \u2014 where each one acts as a new user acquisition channel for the ecosystem while also being another driver of engagement for the existing community.\nAnd by doing so, we are able to offer the opportunity for developers to build and ship games to a live and vibrant community from day 1.\nWithin the Axie Infinity ecosystem, this may look like funding new mini-games that help drive certain goals of the Axie ecosystem such as: better player onboarding, where the creators of the mini-games are rewarded with tokens in real time in correlation to their game\u2019s onboarding success rate. By avoiding reliance on a single team, and by building out in the open, a game is able to scale the width of product insights and approach product development in a far more scientific and engineering-based manner.\nThis ecosystem approach can be applied to all other operational areas of the P2E ecosystem from community development to areas such as worldbuilding and lorecrafting (think community fanfiction or other derivative works that would typically be forbidden from monetization in traditional models). Grassroots capital allocation can emerge via large-scale community funding mechanisms such as quadratic funding or even player-owned guilds that steward certain responsibilities and tasks, such as Axie P2E scholarship guilds that help drive distribution.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/The_ReadingApe/status/1440292285309022221\nWith players having greater control and mobility in the metaverse, we believe interoperability will be a core driver of cross-world distribution. The more open and integrated these economies, games, and worlds are, the more creativity can take place through experiments and permissionless integrations, widening the top of the funnel for the P2E ecosystem. We believe that interoperability is more than just about \u201cbringing your sword from one game to another\u201d, but instead can exist in many forms:\nCosmetic and visuals (VRM avatars, cross-world visual traits, etc.)\nPlayer-world interactions (On-chain physics engine as a shared standard for FPS games, assets that maintain cross-world integrity eg. a plant that needs to be", "doc_id": "924e74bd-ddaa-4b74-8556-b002cb0ca69a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "84aa77bfc4f8e189de116b5e5873fa907f4a424c4b60c8ad2378747d6e601abd", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 242008, "end": 257169}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "6f17e568-a26d-4dab-b294-f9f326f673fa", "3": "ad50c758-6e40-440a-845e-5c7074175903"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad50c758-6e40-440a-845e-5c7074175903": {"text": "players having greater control and mobility in the metaverse, we believe interoperability will be a core driver of cross-world distribution.

We believe that interoperability is more than just about \u201cbringing your sword from one game to another\u201d, but instead can exist in many forms:\nCosmetic and visuals (VRM avatars, cross-world visual traits, etc.)\nPlayer-world interactions (On-chain physics engine as a shared standard for FPS games, assets that maintain cross-world integrity eg. a plant that needs to be watered in the same way across multiple worlds)\nEconomic (Allow users to buy and sell assets with other game tokens or earn discounts for using the tokens of other games/worlds)\nReputational (Cross-world verifiable credentials)\nAchievements (Complete bounties in-game X and Y to unlock a badge)\nEconomic sinks and faucets (Burn X and Y game assets together to produce a unique skin/cosmetic item)\nIP (Seeing lore and characters in one P2E world in another virtual world)\nAccess (In-game item that enables virtual access to virtual spaces across multiple worlds)\nWe believe the opportunity cost of not building for interoperability will overshadow the net cost of doing so.\n\nPlay to earn economies as sinks and faucets\nEconomic sustainability and growth occur when the value flowing into a system is greater than the value leaving it. In game design, the mechanisms influencing value flows in an economy are sinks and faucets:\nSinks take supply of an asset out of an economy\u000b(eg. SLP burned through Axie breeding fees; breeding is incentivized in general to build stronger teams and obtain higher rewards)\nFaucets inject asset supply into an economy\u000b(eg. SLP earned by completing quests or battles)\nFor economies to be sustainable, the sinks need to take more of the token supply out of the economy than the faucets that bring the token into the system, otherwise, there will be natural downward price pressure as supply increases over time.\nAn example of a future token sink is the introduction of Axie body part vertically-integrated upgrades, whether cosmetic or rarity-related, purchased with SLP. Currently, the game\u2019s only SLP sink has been overly reliant on horizontal asset production whereby Axies can come together and breed new ones, but the quality and general appearance of each Axie remains unchanged.\n\nVertically integrated token sinks\nWe can expect to see such tweaks proposed in other emergent P2E games too as they work towards economic sustainability. We can expect communities to crowdsource games and other player experiences that plug into the player economy as either new sinks or faucets \u2014 in order to achieve stability.\nWe may even see other allied virtual nation states integrating sinks or faucets of another economy into their own native experiences in order to assist another P2E ecosystem that is facing economic instability.\n\nRise of the Minimum Viable Game\nWe believe that the biggest P2E ecosystems in the future can potentially start out looking small and humble.\nBy considering P2E economies as the economic and social base layers for an entire ecosystem of games, we believe that building a P2E ecosystem is less about game development and much more about worldbuilding, culture, and incentive design of the underlying economy.\nWhile we would agree that over the long term, well-designed games will engage and retain the biggest player bases, we don\u2019t believe you need to necessarily launch a highly polished game from the start in order to be successful \u2014 but instead, a minimum viable game (MVG) that is enough to complete the economic value accrual loop.\nOne advantage of crypto is being able to immediately launch a token economy from day 0 and begin building minimally viable economic value accrual mechanisms long before there is a fully polished end player experience. This is in contrast to the waterfall development approach that traditional game studios take to launch fully polished games from the start.\nA path to launching a minimum viable game may look like the following:\nCreate a world that others want to belong to (designing a game concept, designing the lore, the aesthetics/visuals, creating a story, designing in-game assets)\nDistribute ownership of that world to a community (tokenize future in-game assets as NFTs and distribute them to early potential community members and players)\nCommunity launches a live economy token to bootstrap a live economy\nCommunity raises capital into a shared treasury\nCommunity launches a minimum viable game with token sinks\nThe minimum viable game removes the economy token from the supply (this needs to be driven by an in-game player world interaction that players have an incentive to leverage eg. a player should believe that burning their tokens is worth it)\nMore value accrued to the economy as tokens are removed from the circulating supply\nValue is reinvested into the game\nBetter game and token sink is created\nRepeat Steps 7 to 9\n\nWe believe by building out the full economic value accrual loop early, P2E ecosystems are able to build games in a much leaner and iterative fashion with much less upfront startup costs.\nAxie Infinity has perfectly embodied the concept of a minimum viable game as its first major raise came before the breeding and battle components were even released:\nDecember 2017: Concept and development begins\nFebruary 2018: 900 ETH Origin Axie raise (~720,000 USD)\nMay 2018: Breeding game release (introduction of a faucet)\nOctober 2018: Idle battle game release (introduction of a sink)\nJanuary 2019: 3200 ETH Initial land sale (~400,000 USD)\nDecember 2019: Card battle game release\nMay 2020: 4600+ ETH complete Quarter 1 land sale (~1,000,000 USD)\nNovember 2020: AXS Token Strategic Sale (860,000 USD)\nApril 2021: Ronin Chain Migration\nSeptember 2021: AXS Token Staking\nDespite the game comprising over 2.5 million daily active users, Axie Infinity\u2019s roadmap is far from complete. Axie Infinity\u2019s focus on community building and their iterative development approach is a testament to how MVGs can be used to bootstrap large scale virtual economies.\n\nA community first approach to building play to earn ecosystems\nDriven by our hands-on experience building token networks, we believe that the most successful and vibrant P2E ecosystems will prioritize community and culture first rather than game play.\nWe believe getting worldbuilding, culture, and incentive design right is mission-critical for building a thriving P2E economy.\nWorldbuilding \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s build a world together.\u201d\nWith the minimum viable game model, shared world building in an early P2E community becomes an important driver of engagement and participation. As such, we expect to increasingly see more P2E ecosystems take a content first approach (eg. Loot, Treasure, CryptoManga). We can expect that early user acquisition for P2E ecosystems will look more like skilled dungeon masters co-creating a D&D world with a community, especially when there is not yet a game ready or even one being built at that time.\nOne example of this is Loot; due to the Yearn-like fair distribution and creative potential of text-based NFTs, dozens of developers saw the potential of a new digital economy that they could build together. Over the following months, 86 community projects came up to expand the possibilities of Loot, including new derivatives, tooling, and guilds around items, maps, lore, and visual renderings.\nWhile we currently lack the tools for player-driven world building, we expect innovations here over the next few years. We suspect generative AI technologies playing a key role as humans shift from a content creator role into a curator role. We see world building as a collaborative process that fosters a community of potential players and other contributors even before there is a game.\n\nCulture building \u2014 \u201cCome for the culture, stay for the ownership.\u201d\nPeople enter a community because they resonate with its culture, and they stay because they become owners of it. Culture is strengthened by demonstrating integrity around a set of values, and principles that inspires others to follow suit. It is co-created within a community, and thus why it is important to curate who is part of an early community.\nWhile the legacy metrics place an emphasis on \u201chow many players does your game have\u201d, we believe P2E ecosystems need to focus on \u201cwho are the players and contributors\u201d. As such we highly encourage P2E ecosystems to carefully curate it\u2019s early community members and players. This can be done via manual whitelisting and other measures such as gated participation via pledge of allegiance or contribution.\n\u201cOne thing that was important in the early days \u2014 many of our community members went \u201call-in\u201d and needed Axie to succeed. Now, NFT community members are also prone to the \u201cVC-effect\u201d where they have too many eggs in too many baskets to care too much about 1 project. There was no diversification back then. Also large demand creates the need for lotteries and other Sybil defenses which prevents people from being able to get the allocation they want.\u201d\n\u2014 Jiho (Axie Infinity)\nGetting the culture right will allow teams to fully take advantage of the fact that by unbundling the publisher, P2E games-as-communities increases the surface area on which values-aligned participants can create impact in the economies they are a part of, and enable them to accrue ownership in the worlds they help create.\n\nAxie Infinity Discord\nIncentive design \u2014 \u201cRewarding valuable contributors\u201d\nWhile culture may initially attract members and contributors to a community, they only stay if they are fairly rewarded for their work and develop an ownership mentality.\n\nDiagram from \u201cHard things about communities\u201d\nWhen designing the distribution of in-game assets and shared upside in the economy, gaming studios should look to ensure that the most valuable community members and contributors are rewarded for their relative work and commitment. When this contributor feedback loop is repeated, trust, loyalty, and fanaticism are developed.\nWe think of token incentives as scarce resources that should be distributed carefully and meritocratically to the most valuable community members. We expect to see greater experimentation around token ownership and in-game asset distribution models. For example:\nOnly guilds of a certain size or collective \u2018XP\u2019 are able to buy exclusive assets such as virtual land\nCertain in-game cosmetics can only be earned by deeply understanding the game\u2019s lore by completing a rigorous knowledge exam\nCompleting quests (either in-game or some other community bounty) as a way for players to whitelist themselves for exclusive item drops, which can subsequently serve as \u201cbadges\u201d that signal their earned reputation\nWe believe P2E games should be careful about designing incentive structures that are based on gameplay alone. By doing so, they expose themselves to the risk of skewing their membership towards mercenaries, who are more likely to jump from game to game in search for higher returns (similar to how yield farmers jump from farm to farm in DeFi protocols).

In that article, we focused on the history of gaming and pretty much a comparison of business models in traditional gaming and crypto gaming projects. Over time, our views on the crypto gaming space have evolved. Further, we have seen quite some criticism of NFTs coming from mainstream gamers. We saw Steam ban crypto games, Discord backtracking on some crypto integrations (their user base is still heavily gaming) and Ubisoft catching a lot of flak on their NFT announcement. So today, we want to talk about where we go from here. This article will have three distinct sections:\nMisconceptions and valid criticisms\nThe benefits of using NFTs and blockchain tech for gaming\nOur somewhat educated guesses about how things might evolve\nMisconceptions and valid criticisms\nTo kick us off, we'll talk about valid criticisms, some misconceptions prevalent in the space, and a few things about the current state of things that are alarming to us. As with most of our articles, we will try to be objective and invite everyone to join us in that approach. Even if just for the next 10 minutes.\nStarting with misconceptions, a quick note on AAA games, a term used left, right and centre in crypto, and what it actually means. This thread is a nice place to start.\n\nEx Populus @ExPopulus\nIt seems like a lot of folks in Web3 may not know what AAA means. There is a loose definition, AAA means a few things:\n3:53 AM \u2219 Jan 23, 2022\n227Likes\n64Retweets\nShare\nBasically, AAA refers to how big and expensive a game is, not necessarily its quality. An average development budget for AAA games is $80-100 million, with a marketing budget of a similar size and teams of 100+ people. Given these characteristics, AAA games are developed by large publishers (think Sony, Nintendo, EA, Activision, Bungie, etc.) and take on average about 3 years to produce. Here's a visual showing budgets of top AAA games for reference.\n\nBefore we get into the meat of the article, we wanted to briefly point out that when it comes to the games themselves, crypto games are not that different from traditional games. They don't actually run on-chain. Dark Forest and maybe the Wolf Game are the only games we know that do. Aavegotchi is another one, but they don't have a game yet, and once they do, it will run in the browser. Basically, all crypto games will either run in the browser or require users to download a game client, which is how traditional games work. \nHowever, what is different are the open economies enabled by blockchain technology and", "doc_id": "ad50c758-6e40-440a-845e-5c7074175903", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b6e8d36a8ccd22c86d63246db7a6bbffa18a5476f83259df1661f1deda0c7cee", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 257089, "end": 272256}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "924e74bd-ddaa-4b74-8556-b002cb0ca69a", "3": "510ee1c8-f324-4ce4-a434-3b00e28fcd95"}, "__type__": "1"}, "510ee1c8-f324-4ce4-a434-3b00e28fcd95": {"text": "Given these characteristics, AAA games are developed by large publishers (think Sony, Nintendo, EA, Activision, Bungie, etc.) and take on average about 3 years to produce.

Aavegotchi is another one, but they don't have a game yet, and once they do, it will run in the browser. Basically, all crypto games will either run in the browser or require users to download a game client, which is how traditional games work. \nHowever, what is different are the open economies enabled by blockchain technology and NFTs, true ownership of in-game assets, and a different economic model for the publisher. Furthermore, a token allows for things like distribution of ownership and governance and effectively aligns the incentives between the developer and the community.\nNow to valid criticisms of crypto gaming.\nThe quality of crypto games today is rather bad. Before you wave this off and say that it will change in the next 12 months, please consider what it takes to build a good game before we even consider integrating NFTs, blockchain tech, wallets, etc.\nNot only are the games bad, but the user experience is horrible too. Downloading a game client, crypto wallet, funding it, buying NFTs on OpenSea to be used in gameplay, signing transactions for simple tasks, and cashing out any rewards while often having to move between multiple chains throughout the process. I mean, who would want to do all that?\nNot every game needs to have a financial element. Crypto people tend to lean towards maximalism, but the truth is that the financialisation of everything is not a good thing. There are many examples where the introduction of financial incentives lead to broken games (Diablo 3 being one of them).\nCrypto games excessively focus on tokenomic, or ponzinomic, design instead of making a game fun to play. Crypto gaming is, therefore, much more GameFi than gaming.\n\nLoopify \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f @Loopifyyy\ngamefi = defi / farming financial incentives with a visual aspect to it\n\nblockchain games = video games where you can earn tokens or nfts as bonuses\n7:37 PM \u2219 Jan 12, 2022\n244Likes\n40Retweets\nValuations are out of control, particularly relative to traditional games. Points 1 and 2 above and the lack of users compared to non-crypto counterparts make valuations even more baffling. There\u2019s a second order effect here where high token prices lead to high USD prices for things like land or in-game items denominated in the native token.\nDistribution is a problem. Getting a crypto game onto Apple Store or Play Store is a challenge. Steam already said they are not supporting crypto games. Epic is a maybe. Furthermore, these gatekeepers take a 30% cut of revenues which changes the economics of crypto games. At the same time, there's a limit to how much you can distribute directly. Although distributing through shareware was quite successful in the 1990s, including for Epic MegaGames, a predecessor to Epic Games.\nMost crypto games with land haven't thought enough about the consequences of having scarce land or that digital land might not even have the same network effects as real-world land.\n\nLars \"Totally Texas\" Doucet @larsiusprime\nPrediction: the fallout from land-based economics in NFT games will be the trigger that gets a lot of techies and game developers into Georgism (and also likely the first time they've ever heard of the philosophy)\n5:27 PM \u2219 Nov 15, 2021\n40Likes\n7Retweets\nWe find two more things rather frustrating when it comes to crypto gaming today.\n1.       Crypto games today are, first and foremost, pay to play games.\nPlayers need capital to start, often thousands of dollars. We came across four different games in the last couple of weeks, whether through Twitter, podcasts, or random comments. When we checked them out, we realised that they required an investment ranging from $2000 to $5,500. In comparison, even the most expensive, mass consumer game consoles only cost $500. Some of the games weren't even live yet. We often call crypto a democratising force where there's equality of opportunity. Well, that's simply not the case in crypto gaming.\n2.       Incentives are broken.\nWe see most teams launching a token before there's even an alpha to capitalise on the hype and raise capital. With valuations where they are, teams are not incentivised to build for the long-term, which leads to short-termism, cash grabs and outright scams. Furthermore, there is even an argument for not delivering a game at all or taking years to do so. Afterall, it\u2019s much easier to sell hype, promises and a narrative than actually deliver a product that will be scrutinised and has to live up to a lofty valuation.\nThe benefits of using NFTs and blockchain tech for gaming\nDespite valid criticisms, we believe there are still many advantages to using NFTs and blockchain tech for gaming. Let's run through some of those.\n1.       Open and trustless economies\nBefore we get into the benefits of open and trustless economies, it's worth pointing out that while traditional games can't quite do trustless, they can undoubtedly do open with a centralised database. It's just that they haven't, for decades. Not only that, but their control over fiat on and off-ramps and exchange rates usually leads to extractive behaviour.\nOpen and trustless economies have many benefits. Players can monetise their time. They can exit a game without losing all the capital they've invested into it. The prices for items and characters are set by the market in an open and transparent manner, not the game developer. These are meaningful improvements to the existing system.\nOn the subject of trustlessness, it\u2019s worth noting that crypto games themselves are not trustless. Often, if not always, the developer has control over the rules of the game and changes to characters through buffs and nerfs, for example. If a developer wanted, they could make your character worthless in the game, even though you would still own the NFT. However, the in-game economies are trustless as long as they utlitise a public blockchain where transactions can\u2019t be censored.\n2.       Equity-like exposure\nThis is the fundamental difference between web2 and web3. Gamers, who are directly responsible for a game's success, should have an option to own a share of that value creation.\nWe also see tokens as a tool to align incentives between a developer, players, streamers, and other ecosystem participants. Funding third-party developers with a native token could be a meaningful value add. Community game mods, for example, tend to add a lot of value. Funding their development with a token would have many benefits, from further utility for the native NFTs to potential sinks for the soft currency like SLP in Axie Infinity.\nEquity-like exposure, however, should come with equity-like regulations which is a risk worth mentioning.\n3.       Governance\nWe do not expect token holders to vote on everything. In fact, we don't think that token voting is even the best model for governance in games. Given the time, capital and effort that goes into developing a game, we would prefer and expect the developers to maintain meaningful control over the decision-making. Furthermore, if we want to see any type of real-world, valuable IP (think Disney) in games, we will need some centralisation as the likes of Disney will need assurances in order to licence their IP.\nThat said, the ability of governance token holders or actual players to have a say, contribute to prioritising features or expansions, etc., is really valuable. Again, you don't need a blockchain for this unless you want it to be trustless. You could drop some kind of token within a centralised database system or allow voting with reputation or XP points. But we've seen minimal effort and experimentation from traditional developers on this front.\n4.       Different economic models\nCrypto games monetise through economic activity, which is possible because of open economies and things like transaction fees and royalties enabled by smart contracts. This is why designing balanced in-game economies is crucial in crypto.\nCircling back to equity-like exposure for a moment, it's pretty evident that having players with an economic stake in the game turns them into a marketing engine. We've seen that time and time again in crypto, with projects often not spending any capital on marketing. If you remember, with AAA games, the marketing budget is usually the same as the development budget. Crypto games can significantly reduce marketing spend by leveraging a well-aligned community with a stake.\nPredictions, guesses, and a wish list\nThis section is where we make some predictions about the future. If nothing else, it will be hilarious to come back to this article in a few years and have a good laugh. \nOur overarching sentiment is that crypto gaming desperately needs a \"trough of disillusionment\" period. We expect that to happen in 2022. Valuations are obscene, there are barely any users, the user experience is bad, barriers to entry are high, in-game economies are laughable, and incentives are misaligned. It is feasible, however, that the space continues to grow and innovate while taking a few years to live up to current valuations. This is more of a muddle through scenario, not necessarily the \"trough of disillusionment\" outcome.\nAt a high level:\nAAA studios are unlikely to launch NFT games or will take a long-time to do so. However, we expect them to study what works and doesn't work in crypto and potentially adopt some of the features, like open economies, within their own centralised ecosystems. Keeping an eye on the profitability and revenue numbers, not users, for crypto games is the best way to predict the behaviour of the majors. At the end of the day, traditional gaming companies, more often than not, are publicly traded and have to optimise for shareholder returns. At worst, we expect the pressure from crypto gaming to lead to changes in behaviour and the adoption of more gamer-friendly policies and strategies.\nCrypto will spawn a few world-class gaming studios. \nWe expect a lot of free-to-play (F2P), mobile and indie studios to make a shift to crypto gaming. This is already happening. The economics are just better. We think crypto gaming is the next economic evolution in gaming, with a free to play to earn (F2P2E) monetisation model being more powerful than a traditional F2P variant. This comes down to a few things mentioned above, from monetising through a tax on trading activity in an open economy to alignment of incentives leading to cheaper and more effective marketing engine.\nFully on-chain games are a no-go. Storing logic on-chain is prohibitively expensive and transaction costs, even on roll-ups today, are too high.\nNow let's talk about things like in-game economies, governance and interoperability. It feels to us like most teams building crypto games have little knowledge about the history of games and virtual worlds. It\u2019s worth checking out this summary of Raph Koster\u2019s presentation on the subject. We especially liked this slide.\n\nWith that in mind, here are our predictions.\nWe expect the in-game economies of crypto games to get much more complex and multi-faceted. We will see experimentation with soulbound items, with tradability of inputs but not the outputs and vice versa, etc. Check out this article on sinks and faucets in gaming economies to get a sense of what's coming. Hopefully, 2022 will be the year of crypto gaming, not crypto GameFi.\nGovernance is tough. As Raph says, players don't want to govern themselves. Further, governance in gaming is very different from governance in DeFi. Games take years to build, require teams of 100+ people, new content has to be shipped continuously, etc. So it's natural that game developers will want to keep control, and they should. Instead, we expect gaming projects to experiment with different governance models that keep the community engaged and allow community members to provide input without ceding too much control. Community elected councils, guild representatives, governance by gamers, not governance token holders, are all exciting models.\u000b(Side note: this deck from Folius Ventures has some great ideas. Specifically, things like \u201cright to govern should be linked to in-game participation\u201d and \u201cRight to rent-seek should be linked to in-game participation\u201d.)\nInteroperability is just not happening. Even interoperable cosmetics are hard as different games might have different specs, formats and graphic requirements. Furthermore, we are not seeing any signs of game developers prioritising interoperability. Instead, they build in silos. Perhaps the best we will get in the short to medium-term is the interoperability of achievements and players history, which might unlock items or rewards across different games.\nWe'll wrap up with a couple of things on our wish list for 2022.\nWe would love to see the emergence of the truly free to play to earn (F2P2E) genre. You get a starting character for free, everyone gets the same one, and you go from there. As you play the game, you are airdropped valuable items. It could be resources or gems used in power-ups or crafting. It could be a small value amount of governance tokens. Naturally, a market will develop between those with capital and those with time. That's okay. But the current environment of having to pay $5,000 just to play a game is not sustainable. It just doesn't make sense to us that we, as an industry, say that users should benefit financially from the time and effort they put in, yet the crypto gaming space requires paying $5,000 to unlock that ability.\nAnother interesting experiment that we would love to see is building a gaming ecosystem from the asset level. Loot tried that - the grassroots, bottom-up approach to building a game but it didn\u2019t succeed for a variety of reasons. However, starting at the asset level would make interoperability easier to achieve. The Magic ecosystem is interesting from this perspective. Given their shorter development cycle, this experiment would have to start with mini-games or mobile games.\u000bA different approach to building from the asset level could be third-party extensions or mods of existing games. Something like a racing game using Axies developed by a community or a third party. This would provide additional utility for Axies and can use SLP as its in-game soft currency. Guilds, for example, could take on the role of funding these ecosystem build outs. They have the assets, they have the player liquidity and they have the capital. Further, the value of guild\u2019s assets (like Axies) is currently entirely dependent on the game developer (Sky Mavis). However, if a guild designs another game around these assets where they control the rules and economics of the game, their reliance on the game developer for value creation would be somewhat reduced.\u000bOne of the best real world examples of this approach is playing cards. The deck is the primary asset and includes 52 cards. There are 100s, if not 1,000s of games out there, all based on the same standard deck. A crypto example of this would be Sorare where there are multiple gaming experiences based on the same set of assets.", "doc_id": "510ee1c8-f324-4ce4-a434-3b00e28fcd95", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6d6c888083038948c091fab91358b86ee179f2ae4e0292cee99ba35c7cdae844", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 272162, "end": 287705}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "ad50c758-6e40-440a-845e-5c7074175903", "3": "3a267113-18db-4bc0-9319-d542e5717bcf"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a267113-18db-4bc0-9319-d542e5717bcf": {"text": "its in-game soft currency.

While we continue to see many benefits in adopting NFTs and blockchain technology for games, the current state of the space is a concern. In our view, crypto gaming is ripe for its \"trough of disillusionment\" moment in 2022. \n\nChris Burniske @cburniske\nPeople get confused & even angry when I\u2019m short term cautionary, but a long term permabull. \n\nEven when the short term caution has been validated\u2026\n\nIf you want to hodl, cool \u2014 my goal is to do better than hodling.\n10:10 PM \u2219 Feb 17, 2022\n192Likes\n14Retweets\nDespite that, we expect to see a lot of innovation and experimentation as developers play around with in-game economics, governance and, perhaps, explore the interoperability white space.\n\n\n\u2014------------------------------\n\nCrypto Gaming is Broken. How Do We Fix It?\nMaybe games shouldn't cost $1,000 to play\n\nNAT ELIASON\nMAY 13, 2022\n35\n1\nShare\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last year deep in the world of crypto gaming. It\u2019s my strongest interest in the space, and the area I feel the most qualified to have opinions on. \nI\u2019m fortunate to have seen crypto gaming from more angles than most people. I was a heavy player of games like Runescape, World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, and DOTA 2, which all demonstrated early experiments at what we\u2019d now call crypto gaming. These experiments ranged from gray markets for in-game currency in World of Warcraft, to \u201cNFTs\u201d of rare items in Runescape and DOTA 2, and the brief attempt at a real-money auction house in Diablo 3. \nI\u2019ve experimented with the past, current, and upcoming crypto games fairly extensively, having spent at least $100k on imaginary land, sneakers, characters, and tokens. I\u2019ve started writing about those analyses more on this site in the last couple of months. \nI\u2019ve also helped build a crypto game economy. I\u2019m an advisor for Crypto Raiders, where I assist on the game economy and tokenomics. Through hands-on building a crypto game economy and seeing it function in the wild, I\u2019ve gotten to test a number of different theses. I\u2019m also getting more exposure to these ideas in practice through additional games that I\u2019ve started working with on their economies in the last few months. \nCrypto gaming is brand new. Hardly anyone has more than a year or two of experience in it. So while I still feel very green at all of this, I also feel fairly qualified to lay out some of the issues I see in the space right now, and some ways we might improve on them moving forward. \nI\u2019m extremely bullish on crypto gaming. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted for well over a decade, though I didn\u2019t know the words for it until recently. I\u2019m confident gaming will eventually grow to be a trillion-dollar industry within crypto. So while this article is very critical of the space currently, don\u2019t assume that means I don\u2019t believe in it. Quite the opposite. I believe in it deeply, and want to help make it the best it can be.\nAs such, this is also not an explicit prescription for all games. It\u2019s rather a list of problems, and a list of possible solutions or experiments to run. I only have so much time and so many projects I can work with, so I\u2019m sharing it in the hopes that many teams will run with these ideas, iterate on them, and hopefully make the space stronger together.\nWith that, let\u2019s dive into the analysis. If you have any thoughts after reading this, I\u2019d love to hear them on Twitter.\nCurrent Problems in Crypto Gaming\nThere are a few common issues in crypto gaming currently, which I\u2019ll go through in no particular order:\nNFTs set a bad precedent for games\nDeFi set a bad precedent for games \nMost earnings are unsustainable\nThe costs are too high for game lifecycles\nMuch of the work is bullshit\nToo much power for people with capital vs. time\n\u201cPlay to Earn\u201d sets the wrong expectations for players\nNFTs Set a Bad Precedent for Games\nThe NFT wave kicked off at the beginning of 2021. It started with art, then moved into profile pictures, and started to creep into gaming along the way. \nIt\u2019s important to highlight that NFT popularity started with art and collectibles with rarity and fixed supplies. The strategy for investing in these collectibles was to simply buy and hold them. If you picked right, the number went up, and you made money once you sold them to the next buyer. \nThis standard for NFT investing set a bad precedent for gaming. Making characters NFTs that people could speculate on opened up gaming to the same expectations for Number Go Up. But the idea that you could buy a basic account for a game, hold on to it, and expect it to get more valuable is absurd. \nNonetheless, there is a heavy focus in NFT games on the \u201cfloor price,\u201d the cheapest price of entry for the NFTs. A game with a decreasing floor price is seen as dying even if it means the game is getting more accessible for new players.\nIt is extremely hard to build an economically sound game and a happy community when you start with 10,000 NFTs worth thousands of dollars. You\u2019ll need to bring the price of NFTs down considerably to make the game attractive to the number of players you need to onboard. And by starting with high-value assets, you\u2019ll attract more speculators than players, exactly the opposite of who you want to populate your early game community. \nDeFi Set a Bad Precedent for Games\nThe first wave of crypto games are essentially a marriage of NFTs and DeFi. We took the ponzi loops that exist in DeFi (buy our token, stake it for more of the token, sell the tokens you earn, and hope you make an ROI before it all collapses!) and just added extra steps. The breeding loops that exist in many NFT games are the same as yield farming, there are just colorful characters attached to them. \nFurther, DeFi yield and staking set expectations for what a token should do. People expect that they can buy a game\u2019s token and earn passive yield from it without playing the game. But introducing that passive yield ends up breaking the in-game economy. \nCrypto gaming needs to break away from the expectations of NFTs, and the expectations of DeFi. Copying those paradigms helped get it started, but they\u2019re now actively hurting it. \nMost Earnings are Unsustainable\nIf all the sinks in a game increase the earnings of participants in the game, the economy has to collapse eventually. You cannot keep increasing everyone\u2019s earning potential without having some massive inflation on the reward currency which will eventually cause its value to collapse. \nA simple way to test this for a game is to ask what the primary token sinks are, and what they do to the economy when they\u2019re utilized. If all of the main sinks increase people\u2019s ability to earn, then the game is unsustainable. If the main sinks do not increase earnings, the game might have a sustainable economy. It is necessary but not sufficient. \nThis was my main criticism of STEPN. While the game is fun and has a better economic design than most games right now, most of the sinks increase earnings in the game right now, so it has to collapse in some way eventually unless they\u2019re able to mitigate this. \nThe Costs are Way Too High for Game Lifecycles\nHow long does a good game last? Two years? Five? Very few games last 10+ years. So we have to consider the short lifespans of most games when assessing the values of game assets. \nThere are essentially three ways to value something:\nIntrinsic non-monetary value (status, happiness, etc)\nCash flow (it makes you money)\nAppreciation (speculation that you can sell it for more)\nThere are 100,000 pieces of land for Otherside, the Bored Ape Yacht Club metaverse. These pieces of land have a floor price right now of $6,000 and get more expensive from there. \nLet\u2019s say the price averages out to $10,000 per land across all 100,000 pieces of land. That\u2019s about $1b of Otherside land. If we generously assume the BAYC metaverse will be popular for 10 years, you have to ask if you can at least break even on your land in that time period, assuming you aren\u2019t happy to spend $10,000 just to play with no promise of return. \nThe only way you get a return is if you can sell your land to someone else for more, or if you can generate a good cash flow off of it. But selling it to someone else for more is the normal ponzinomics we\u2019re used to and want to move away from. \nBut you can see the problem here pretty quickly. Assuming you want at least a 10% annual cashflow on your BAYC land, the whole ecosystem would need to pay out $100,000,000 a year to land owners. Say BAYC can match Fortnite\u2019s popularity, which generates about $5b a year in revenue. Could BAYC give away 2% of its revenue to land owners? \nThat\u2019s not too unreasonable, but we then have to weigh it against the odds that BAYC can build a game as popular as Fortnite and then sustain that popularity for a decade. \nPossible? Yes, but it\u2019s not a bet I\u2019d be willing to take. I think we have to acknowledge that most of the value in these assets is speculation on the appreciation. People expect the number to go up and are going to be very sad when the music stops. And yes it does have to stop eventually.  No game lasts forever.\nMuch of the \u201cPlay\u201d to Earn is Bullshit Work\nIn an ideal version of Play and Earn, you would be able to cash out some of the value you accrue from playing a fun game. Or, you would get paid by making some meaningful economic contribution to the game, like designing a popular skin that other players buy. \nThat is not how most \u201cEarning\u201d works right now. Most of it comes from doing some form of bullshit work, usually slightly obfuscated button clicking. And to be fair that\u2019s not an unusual thing, especially in MMOs: mining for copper in Runescape isn\u2019t exactly thrilling. But if you\u2019re earning from logging in every few hours to click a few buttons, to do something the game could just remove from the necessary activities to focus on more fun stuff, you\u2019ve kinda just created a weird job. \nFarming-style loops and land management games are a common example of this. And to be clear, I\u2019m not saying this is necessarily bad, but if the bulk of the earnings comes from logging in every few hours and clicking something you haven\u2019t really built a fun game that people make money from. Unless you can make the land management complex to the level of Sim City or competitive in some way. I do think it would be interesting to create a Web3 Sim City games where you create trade deals to share resources between different cities\u2026 but I digress.\nPeople with Capital have Instant Power\nRight now much of the power in P&E games is instantly accessible to those with large amounts of capital. They can buy tons of resources, run the economic loops faster, and quickly gain significant control of the market. \nThis is demotivating for the true players who likely have more time than capital. The highest earning potential should accrue to the people putting the most time and energy into the game, and there should be limits on how close to that you can get by deploying large amounts of capital. \nAssume that people with lots of money to deploy into your game are there to milk it for yield, not to play it. Plan the game accordingly. If it can be farmed, it will be farmed, and the losers will be the people who are there for fun.\n\u201cPlay to Earn\u201d Sets the Wrong Expectations\nFor a game to be sustainable, players can\u2019t be able to jump in and immediately start making a good ROI on their investment. And the easier it is to do the math on how you get to ROI positive, the more the game will be farmed by people with large amounts of capital. \nThis is where the Play and Earn terminology is quite a bit better. Most gameplay should not be disguised bullshit work, it should be actual gameplay. And the earnings should be difficult to calculate, especially for newer players. \nFinally, earnings should be irregular, with large jackpots instead of steady income. The harder it is to predict a steady income from the game, the more you\u2019ll be able to build it around actual gameplay instead of DeFi loops. \nOkay, those are most of the high-level issues. Now let\u2019s go through some of the ways I think we can combat them. \nHow Can We Fix It?\nAs I said in the intro, this is not a blanket prescription, but rather a list of ideas and things I think crypto games should try. The space is still very new, and we\u2019re all experimenting and figuring things out.\nSignificantly reduce the cost to entry\nCreate limitations on the power of new capital\nPrioritize rewarding play not clicking\nGet rid of staking\nBuild a fun game first \nSeparate the external & internal economy as much as possible \nObscure the ROI \nReframe expectations around P&E\nNot limiting play\nSignificantly Reduce the Cost to Entry\nHaving to spend $10,000 to play a game is stupid. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. The only reason this feels somewhat normal right now is that we\u2019re all high off NFT season and have copied those paradigms over. \nBut the idea that you have a $10,000 starter account for a game is absurd and turns off the very many players who would probably love to try your game but can\u2019t afford to invest a decent used car into it. \nIt also adds significant stress to the economy because the gameplay earnings now have to justify this huge startup cost. If you want to try to get to ROI in 3 months, you need to be making $3,333 a month from your starter account. So either other people need to be putting in $3,333 per month into the ecosystem for you to earn, or you have to benefit from ponzinomics. It\u2019s almost always the latter. \nJoining a crypto game should be free, or comparable to the cost of a normal game (under $60). I\u2019m partial to the Free-to-Play model, and some teams are doing interesting experiments in this direction", "doc_id": "3a267113-18db-4bc0-9319-d542e5717bcf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4e20c18d68ad4d1a19f8aeca23e9877a504d93d22556b339315c2d85fb05f8a1", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 287722, "end": 302365}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "510ee1c8-f324-4ce4-a434-3b00e28fcd95", "3": "cd7cd810-16c6-46d9-9282-24187d0de293"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd7cd810-16c6-46d9-9282-24187d0de293": {"text": "starter account for a game is absurd and turns off the very many players who would probably love to try your game but can\u2019t afford to invest a decent used car into it. \nIt also adds significant stress to the economy because the gameplay earnings now have to justify this huge startup cost. If you want to try to get to ROI in 3 months, you need to be making $3,333 a month from your starter account. So either other people need to be putting in $3,333 per month into the ecosystem for you to earn, or you have to benefit from ponzinomics. It\u2019s almost always the latter. \nJoining a crypto game should be free, or comparable to the cost of a normal game (under $60). I\u2019m partial to the Free-to-Play model, and some teams are doing interesting experiments in this direction (e.g. Genopets and Sunflower Land). \nThis will significantly reduce what people can earn from playing in the beginning but that\u2019s good, there\u2019s less pressure on you to try to keep the token prices high so people can earn a crazy amount from the game. And it means people\u2019s expectations are much lower. They\u2019re not sweating over the $10k investment. They can actually enjoy the game. \nIf you already launched a 10k collection with a high price though, what do you do? We tried to deliberately bring the price of characters down at Crypto Raiders but it didn\u2019t get taken very well. The problem with the NFT biases is people are laser-focused on the floor price. So while we made progress on our goal to reduce the cost of entry for the game, many people were extremely upset that they couldn\u2019t sit on their characters to flip them for more later. \nBut I stand by doing some kind of model like that. The way I was thinking about it, if you can over time turn your 1 $10,000 character into 10 $1,000 characters, or even 100 $100 characters, then you\u2019ve significantly reduced the barrier to entry without destroying any value for the original buyers. That might be your best bet. \nSome will say that renting and scholarships are a solution here, but I don\u2019t love them. The point of crypto gaming is to get to own your gaming assets, it\u2019s kinda lame to have to borrow them from someone else or apply for a scholarship. \nThe economies of Runescape and WoW worked fine with people creating new Level 1 accounts all the time. Access should be free or extremely cheap, and the earnings should come later through sufficient work. \nCreate Limitations on the Power of Capital\nSomeone with a bunch of money shouldn\u2019t be able to swoop in and dominate the game or the game economy. \nOne way this happens right now is breeding. A person or guild with a ton of capital can buy up many of the assets, start running a breeding operation and have a huge influence on the market without really having to play the game. \nAnother area we will likely see this is with game item marketplaces. If someone can come in and buy the rarest items in the game, they can immediately start winning tournaments or farming the best rewards without having to put much effort in. \nOn the breeding and economic loops side, there should be some limits to how quickly someone can deploy capital. STEPN has an interesting barrier for this built into sneaker leveling. Since a sneaker has to be level 5 to mint with it, and since you can only level one sneaker at a time, and since breeding has a 48-hour cooldown, no matter how much money you have you can\u2019t realistically mint more than once every 36 hours or so. It\u2019s very different from breeding in other games where you could theoretically buy 100 characters and breed 100 more from them. There\u2019s no way to have that kind of multiplicative growth in your sneaker collection. \nAnother way you can build in controls for this is through soulbound items. The best gear in a game should be Bind On Pickup so it cannot be sold. It can be used to win tournaments and farm lower-level, sellable gear, but it cannot be sold itself. This ensures the highest-earning and competitive potential is held by people actively playing the game, and can\u2019t be bought by newcomers. Let people buy up to 80-90% of the best gear, but never the best. \nFinally, you could make certain ROI-increasing activities non-transferrable, such as investments into land upgrades that have timers associated with them. \nOne small criticism I have of Crypto Unicorns is that land upgrades transfer on sale, and they take no time to purchase. So you could buy a piece of land on OpenSea, sink some money into it, and immediately be economically competitive with people who have been playing the game for a month. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ideal. There should be some additional benefits from playing the game for a while.\nPrioritize Rewarding Playing, Not Clicking\nThis is more of a spectrum than a fine line, but for games to be primarily fun with a side of earning, the earnings should come from activities closer to \u201cplay\u201d than repetitive clicking. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean farming games are bad, just that they should have a decent strategy and tactical layer attached to them. There should be tradeoffs. It should be hard to whip up a spreadsheet and calculate the optimal way to play. And buying resources to click \u201cbreed\u201d and sell the new NFTs definitely shouldn\u2019t be the primary earning mechanism. \nIf breeding is the primary earnings mechanism, that means people aren\u2019t paying to play the game, they\u2019re paying to play the breeding ponzi. A game has succeeded when people are paying for high-level gear, or additional dungeon runs, or cosmetics. Things that let them play the game more, or that let them flex in whatever the game\u2019s social context is. \nLimiting the best rewards to PvP, end-game content, challenges, leaderboards, and other more competitive activities helps ensure this is the case. \nThe analogy I often come back to is that someone signing up for a brand new Runescape account couldn\u2019t expect to immediately make an impact on the Grand Exchange. Someone who buys a character NFT or signs up for your game shouldn\u2019t be able to immediately reap the economic rewards either. \nGet Rid of Staking\nStaking tends to be implemented in one of two ways, neither of which makes sense.\nEither, you stake the governance token to get more of the governance token. This is dumb since now you\u2019re rewarding DeFi people with deep pockets instead of your actual players. And staking isn\u2019t doing anything besides slowing them down from selling, which is nice, but it doesn\u2019t improve the game. \nOr, you stake the governance token to get a share of in-game revenue. This is kinda dumb too since now you have to make the in-game economy much lossier, preventing most players from actually earning anything while playing because you\u2019re paying out rewards to stakers instead of actual players. You could just give a share of fees from something like the in-game marketplace, but then you\u2019ve impacted your own ability to generate revenue. \nI think it makes much more sense to treat the governance token as the most valuable finite resource in the game and use it for the most impactful upgrades to characters or accounts. This allows characters to accrue value over time since these upgrades will necessarily become finite, and gives the token a reason for existing and being held. Instead of locking up supply by having people put it in a staking contract, lock up supply by having people put it in the game. \nBuild a Fun Game First\nThis might seem like a revolutionary thought, but I think for a crypto game to work it needs to be an actually fun game first. \nIf no one wants to play your game when they aren\u2019t making money from it, they\u2019ll run for the exits and dump everything at the first sign of market trouble. And if the internal economy of the game doesn\u2019t work without external token activity influencing it, then the game is starting off on an unstable footing that will be hard to build out of. \nThis seems so stupidly obvious, but it\u2019s so rarely done. Probably because launching a token is such an incredible way to raise money, and games are very expensive to make. So you do have some challenges here. How do you wait to incorporate your token until you\u2019ve built a fun game, and how do you build a fun game without a token as a fundraising mechanism? \nWell, you can of course raise money the normal way. But I also think community members can be more patient than we assume. Illuvium is doing a good job of this right now. They have a token that\u2019s been launched for a while, and they\u2019re now introducing people into the beta of their game, but there\u2019s no way to earn within the game yet. That\u2019s coming later. They\u2019re focused on building a really fun game first, then introducing the earning elements once it\u2019s more established. \nSeparate the Internal and External Economies\nIt\u2019s tempting to try to balance your in-game costs around the external value of the tokens, but this becomes a distraction and results in a frustrating in-game experience for your players. \nThe two economies should operate independently. The game should function the same whether 1 gold in the game is worth $0.001, or $1. There will be periods of surging interest in the game where people will flock to it and push up the price of the tokens, and there will be lulls where the token prices drop. Throughout those times, the experience of playing the game should stay consistent. Otherwise, you\u2019re constantly going to be changing the economy of the game to chase the token price, and it\u2019s going to make the whole thing rather confusing for everyone. \nOne example of not doing this well, in my opinion at least, is STEPN\u2019s recent decision to base minting costs on the relative prices of their tokens. \n\nThis makes one of the game's core loops extremely hard to predict on a day-to-day basis, and makes minting annoying to try to do the math on. Maybe that\u2019s the point, but it makes minting less fun and more transactional of an experience. And the main benefit is that it helps pump up their governance token price, while maybe making the game more affordable in the short term by pulling down the price of GST.\nEither way, people shouldn\u2019t have to check Coingecko to decide or know what to do in your game. \nObscure the ROI\nAssuming again that any easily mapped economic cycle will get taken advantage of, we should make it very hard to calculate the ROI from playing a game. \nMeasuring ROI is important for many games right now because they have such high startup costs. You don\u2019t want to spend $10,000 on a character or piece of land if you\u2019re not sure how you\u2019re going to earn that back. But if games are inexpensive to start, as I think they should be, then this becomes much less of a concern. \nIt\u2019s still worth thinking about how you can obscure the cost-benefit analysis of in-game activities though. One way is through having rewards that have a high variance. \nPerhaps running a dungeon in a game has an expected value of $0.20. But 90% of the time, you\u2019re only earning $0.10 and 10% of the time you\u2019re earning $1.10. That\u2019s a very simplified version but you get the idea. You can know that a player should have some rough ROI over a few months or years of playing, without them being able to easily calculate it in the game due to the variance of outcomes. \nThis is already a common design standard in games with loot boxes, rare drops, and other mechanics, but we oddly haven\u2019t seen as much of it yet with Play & Earn, probably because so much of the earning is based on \u201cwork\u201d rather than \u201cplay.\u201d \nReframe Expectations Around P&E\nThis will be the hardest, but the most important. As an industry, we need to shift the expectations away from P&E games being something you can quickly mine for a profit, to games that are actually fun to play where you happen to be able to cash out some of your work. \nA good model for this being done currently might be DOTA 2. You wouldn\u2019t think of it as a P&E game, since there\u2019s no crypto involved and there are no \u201cwork\u201d like activities for you to earn anything of value. But the assets in the game do have value on their in-game marketplace, so if you get something you didn\u2019t want from a loot box, you can sell it to someone else. \nThe vast majority of players end up spending more than they earn. I\u2019m actually not sure anyone is net positive in this marketplace unless you have some of the very early very rare items. But it\u2019s a good example of how a game can have a marketplace without having the fun destroyed by it. \nIf a game requires a decent amount of playtime before earning becomes possible, and if once that earning is possible it\u2019s hard to calculate the ROI on it and it\u2019s secondary to the actual gameplay, you\u2019ll likely have a much more sustainable game economy on your hands. \nNot Limiting Play\nThe last change I hope we move toward is to create P&E games that don\u2019t need to limit the ability for players to enjoy the game. \nEnergy, recharging, and other time-based limitations are a good way to limit the inflation in the game. But they do limit how much someone can enjoy your game, and if you\u2019ve built a good game, you\u2019ll end up disappointing people who want to play it. \nInstead we should aim to have a lot of the game be freely playable an unlimited amount, and only have the capital-generating activities have limitations. Other games with robust economies in the past had very minor limitations on the economic activity in the game. You could essentially mine all the copper you wanted in Runescape or WoW, and they turned out fine. But we could still limit the extremely valuable activities, like end-game dungeons or harvesting the rarest resources. \nThis may also tie into the concept of building a fun game first. If the game is broadly fun and has earning added in later, there will be plenty of things to do that aren\u2019t tied to earning. And that might end up solving some of this problem on its own. \nMoving Forward\nThis was a bit of a brain dump, but I hope it\u2019s useful to any team trying to build a Play and Earn game. \nWe all have an incredible opportunity to be among the first to figure this out. To build this generation\u2019s World of Warcraft or Runescape scale game, but with a real-world economy attached to it.\nI\u2019m extremely bullish on this space. It\u2019s the sector of crypto I\u2019m most excited about.

Utilities, Rare collectibles, Gambles\nUtilities\nCharge players for small quality-of-life upgrades or for the use of public goods as a token sink. This taps into a player\u2019s desire for accomplishment and her desire to avoid unnecessary time expenditures.\nSome examples are\nFlight paths in WoW and mounts/upgrades for faster travel (magic carpet rides in OSRS)\nArmor repair (OSRS, Elder Scrolls)\u200a\u2014\u200anotably this replicates real-life depreciation costs\nTolls for accessing areas (Al Kharid gate), including instanced dungeon costs\nSalons to change your appearance or name (Salon Durem in Gaia)\nThe ability to pay to reset your stats/skill trees\nBuying and decorating houses (Elder Scrolls, Final-Fantasy)\nMost of these utility-type sinks are accepted as a staple of games \u2014 a tax so frequently paid that its pain becomes negligible. On the other hand, there have been examples of utility tax sinks so egregious that they drove away many players. (Note responses to poll above)\nFor instance in Aion Classic, enchantment stones gave additional stats boosts to your weapons and armor. A maxed competitive end-game character, both for PvE and PVP required at least +10 boosts in armor and weapons, while the maximum possible enchantment was +15. Upon every failure past +10, the weapon/armor returned to +10 enchantment. Players not only had to grind hundreds of hours for stones, but they failed incredibly often and required large amounts of cash per enchantment attempt.\nWatch as a player wastes weeks of work to get nowhere. At the very least, this was the reason why I stopped playing.\nPhantasy Star Online 2 also uses the same upgrade mechanic. For the highest tier (11 or 12-star weapon) the odds are 0.0014% to upgrade it to +10 in one go, and each weapon requires +10 three times over to fully upgrade.\nTakeaway: Grinding is not inherently evil. It fosters a sense of mastery and advancement, but only up to a point. Tough utility taxes can be useful gold sinks, but those that require grinds that are more frustrating than rewarding will result in player attrition.\nRare Collectibles\nPeriodically auction/sell rare collectibles in in-game currency. This can be done consistently through a luxury merchant NPC, as part of a special event, or as a gambling game. This is driven by a player\u2019s desire for social influence and ownership.\nExamples include\nCollectibles in Neopets\nNeverwinter\u2019s Sergeant Knox auction\nCondensed gold, sold by an NPC in Runescape, required to make the (literal) Gold sink\n\nA player suggested idea: a literal gold sink\nAs per our poll above, this is one of the most community-friendly gold sinks.\nAs you can see gold sink idea above had great reception as both a meme and a wealth flex.\nGambles\nGambling games are designed to have a negative monetary expected value, but players are incentivized to play because this is the only way to obtain rare cosmetics, is an easy way to obtain extremely rare items, or is fun. See gacha games. Each time a player participates, they must pay in the native token. Because expected payout is negative, this is a token sink. This is driven by the player\u2019s desire for ownership.\nExpected Value = Fun - EV(monetary loss) > EV(monetary gain)\nExamples include\nthe Squeal of Fortune/Treasure Hunter in RS3\nthe Raffle House in Kingdom of Loathing\n\nPlayers rioting post Squeal of Fortune Update\nFrom our poll, gambling was by far the most hated form of gold sink. We conjecture that this is because many gambling gold sinks created pay-to-win avenues.\nTakeaway: Don\u2019t create pay-to-win highways through gambling games. Embed rare collectibles into the lore and experience or make it a meme. People love flexing their wealth.\nSolution 2. Taxes, trade, and land\nLevy taxes on auction houses, marketplaces, p2p trades, and on the possession of land/houses (a Georgian Land Value Tax). This requires first for the game creators to control a marketplace.\nExamples are\nAuction house fees in MMOs (WoW, Diablo, Runescape). Of particular note is that the auction house fees (Grand Exchange Trade Tax of 2%) in Runescape are used to buy back items in the GE. This can be algorithmically adjusted to target items that are undergoing bursts of additional supply. The tax also positively encourages player-to-player interaction, adding social depth to the game.\nTaxes on idle resources. Lars Doucet outlines Henry George\u2019s Land Value Tax applied to Eve Online Factories, and how that successfully combated the problem of rampant factory speculation. Star Atlas also will take this approach (see pg 6. Of their Economics Paper).\nThe 4.25% of tax on Axie Marketplace sales.\n\nImage source: https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/monthly-economic-report-october-2021\nTransaction taxes have historically been the largest sink for ISK (Eve currency) for the past 2 years. The broker\u2019s fee (another marketplace tax) comes at a close third.\nIn a game where trade becomes a larger portion of gameplay in later stages \u2014 most MMOs would fall under this category \u2014 adding a heavy transaction tax effectively takes currency out of the oldest and richest players\u2019 coffers, taking currency out of the game where it is the most abundant while preserving holdings of new players going through the onboarding process.\nApplied to Axie these mechanisms look like the following:\nTakeaway: Taxes come at an unfortunate third in the most-hated gold sink poll, but they are very effective. Tax marketplaces, trade and idle resources, and use tax revenue for additional burning or community oriented activities. Perhaps experiment with new taxation models taken from the large history of optimal taxation literature to find one that works even better than those tried before.\nSolution 3. Crafting\nCrafting can act as both an item and a currency sink. Players use lower-level items to create higher tier items/consumables/cosmetics which consume component items and at times in-game currency. This is driven by a player\u2019s desire for mastery, curiosity in discovering new items and experiences, and creativity in finding new combinations.\nGuildwars2 has a crafting mechanic used as an item sink. Crafting functions as a black hole for both lower and higher-level materials.\nAnother example is the Construction skill in Runescape. Leveling up construction requires repeatedly building and then destroying furniture, consequently destroying the materials consumed to make it. Each plank required to construct furniture costs money to create, while nails and other components must be created or purchased. In the existence of a taxable marketplace, high dollar-volume trades incentivized by difficult-to-train skills can be a powerful gold sink. Planks are some of the most heavily traded items on the Grand Exchange. Note that to reach the maximum level, construction requires at least a 100m GP investment (nearly 400M for the fastest method) which is a lot of GP for a casual player.\nCrafting an item sink only works if the item being produced via crafting is not widely available in the marketplace or by other means. If an item is obtainable through methods that take less time and money than crafting, and/or players can easily buy up raw materials then sell the crafted product for a profit, this system may end up generating even more gold in the system.\nTakeaway: Used well, crafting can be both an addition to the experience, lore and social aspects of the game while providing both a healthy source of a sense of mastery/advancement and a currency sink.\nSolution 4. Staking/Locking up Currency\nThis is much more familiar for those in crypto, but similar solutions exist in web2 games.\nManaging Miscellania is a minigame in Runescape. A player can deposit up to 5\u20137.5M gold (depending on quest completions) in coffers. Every day, up to 50\u201375K is taken out of the coffers and paid to \u201cworkers\u201d who harvest resources, which are then claimable by the player. The rewards tend to always be profitable but are resources that are widely required and consumed while skilling. Players deposit gold into the coffers because of their desire for accomplishment \u2014 advancing their skills.\n\nManaging Miscellania effectively locks and burns millions of coins and swaps them for lower velocity items or consumables necessary for progressing in the game.\nTakeaway: Rotate high velocity currency to low velocity items or consumables.\nSolution 5. Unlock More Game Content\nInstead of requiring fiat to purchase additional game content, membership, DLCs (downloadable content), sell it for a large amount of in-game currency to players. The quality of content and player experience will be the key driver in affecting the player\u2019s desire for unpredictability (curiosity) and accomplishment (to finish all of the game) and enticing them to purchase additional content with in-game currency.\nRunecsape bonds grant 14 days of membership but can be bought from another player for 4.7M GP each. 1 month purchased through fiat costs 11USD. In just the past hour of writing (Weekday ET 9pm) 553 bonds have been bought on the Grand Exchange, for a total of approximately 2,500,000,000 GP. Pro-rated this means bonds are approximately 1.2% of daily GP traded a year. 2,500,000,000 GP is also around 250 hours of gold farmed using the highest gp/hr method available in-game. Check live data here.\nIf Jagex were to instead sell bonds for GP, this would generate an extremely healthy gold sink.\nTakeaway: Rotate pay to play to skill/play to play. Considering web3 games don\u2019t monetize through purchases of the game from the producer, this can work especially well.\nSolution 6. Donations/Events\nThe most community-friendly gold sink according to our Reddit poll and in my personal experience is donations and events. Incentivize people to give away/burn gold in goodwill or for rare collectibles and titles by enticing their desire for meaning or social influence.\nExamples include\nGaia online\u2019s 2009 Bailout event. To accompany the remodeling of NPC shops, Gaia hosted a timely Bailout 2009 event, where each shop was purported to owe taxes to the \u201cGRS\u201d and players needed to donate to each shop to make sure it survived the update. One criticism of the event was that the outcome was pre-determined regardless of the total amount donated, and that larger donors didn\u2019t receive additional benefits.\n\nBecause it is easy to automatically return funds if a threshold is not met in crypto, it becomes much easier for game developers to create funding-dependent updates as community events.\nThe Well of Goodwill in RS3 took donations in items and gold. Jagex, the parent company of Runescape, then matched GP donations at a ratio to GBP and donated to charities.\n\nA player donates to the well\nThose who donated above a certain amount to the Well of Goodwill received rare titles \u2014 perhaps the rarest and most coveted of items within games.\nThe well allowed those that didn\u2019t have a bank account or had trouble wiring money to donate in a way that felt as if it were low-cost basis (via accepting in-game currency), fun, and community aligned. Those who donated more than 5B GP (a truly STAGGERING amount for those who\u2019ve never played the game) were awarded the title \u201cThe Billionaire\u201d. Big Flex.\nDespite the well\u2019s immense popularity, the well will not be returning the game.\nNote the other sad responses on the removal of the Well of Goodwill \u2014 an unlikely occurrence in removing any other gold sink.\nIn line with the Reddit poll, I personally really enjoyed this type of sink. It bred a community experience that integrated with the lore, and updates to the game in the case of Gaia. In the case of Runescape, it gave great bragging rights and added an element of fun and achievement to donations and gold burning.\nTakeaway: Integrate gold sinks directly into community events/lore. Create fun experiences around gold sinks and give people/guilds visible bragging rights dependent on the amount of gold burned.\n\nPart 2: Solutions uniquely enabled by Crypto\nIn the previous section, we explored balancing solutions tried and tested by traditional games. Web3 games, however, come with multiple additional opportunities to produce organic sinks and balancing mechanisms. These include seeding mods and forks to community-led sinks. Both rely on the open-source, interoperable, and community-first nature of web3 games and only work for truly decentralized community & culture first p2e games.\nSolution 1. Seed mods and forks as token sinks\nHistorically speaking,\nmodded versions of games have always been at the forefront of pushing gameplay to new frontiers and genres. In fact, some of the most popular games of all time were inspired or directly created in/as mods of other games.\nFrom \u201cPower to the Players: Open Source\u201d.\nDay Z for instance was at first a mod of Arma 2. Dean Hall took the best aspects of Arma 2 and transformed it into a survival game with zombies. Soon there were spin-offs of spin-offs of DayZ, including a mod developed by a then-unknown \u201cPlayer Unknown\u201d named Day Z: Battle Royale.

Dean Hall took the best aspects of Arma 2 and transformed it into a survival game with zombies. Soon there were spin-offs of spin-offs of DayZ, including a mod developed by a then-unknown \u201cPlayer Unknown\u201d named Day Z: Battle Royale. This not only popularized the battle royale genre but later evolved into PUBG, one of the most popular video games in history.\n\nAnother famous mod: Defense Against the Ancients (Dota) started as a mod of Warcraft III and popularized the MOBA\nBecause Web3 games can monetize through secondary sales and taxes on core infrastructure, and thus benefit from the expansion of the entire game ecosystem, they have strong incentives to seed new mods and player creations which in turn creates organic demand for their ecosystem tokens. This is a natural counterforce to the innovator\u2019s dilemma and can create ever-evolving and thereby longer-lasting games.\nThis is the strategy taken by Sandbox, Aavegotchi, and Sky Mavis. The core team, in all three cases, have built infrastructure, deep liquidity, and an initial ownership base. Next, they encourage ecosystem entrepreneurs to build mods and subgames atop their platform and collect revenue in the form of an activity tax. This is why Axie is branding itself as a \u201cnation\u201d.\nYou can think of Axie as a nation with a real economy. The holders of the AXS token are the government that receives tax revenues. The inventors/builders of the game, Sky Mavis, hold ~20% of all AXS tokens.\nFrom the Axie Whitepaper.\nAavegotchi minigames are community-developed games that are playable only by those who have an Aavegotchi. Because each game is different, Aavegotchis with different traits are beneficial for different games. In many cases, an Aavegotchi that has a lower base rarity score performs better than one with a higher rarity score in certain minigames creating demand for a wide variety of Aavegotchis. For designated periods of time, playing the minigame can also earn you XP, giving you a higher chance of winning a leaderboard GHST prize. According to the Aavegotchi wiki:\nEach mini-game will use different Aavegotchi traits to enable fair gameplay for a wide variety of trait distributions. For example, a HYPER-AGGRESSIVE Aavegotchi may perform well in an Aavegotchi Fight Club, but may not be well-suited to a cake-baking mini-game.\n\nSushivader an Aavegotchi minigame\nBut in order to use the strategies above, games have to decentralize (can\u2019t rug access) while incentivizing talent building on the platform (see the Roblox DevEx program). They have to also allow modders and ecosystem developers to take a cut of the economic output they create (through royalties and contribution-correlated rewards).\nTakeaway: Allow community devs and game designers to create experiences that drive organic demand for your tokens and infrastructure.\nSolution 2. Community-based Burn Mechanisms\nJon Huang estimates that approximately 98% of Axie DAU are scholars. Considering Axie has a DAU of 2M and YGG as the largest guild has 10K scholars, we can estimate that the number of scholars in guilds probably does not exceed 5\u201310%. If this number increases, or if we factor into account small managers, then introducing burning mechanisms at the guild-scholar level becomes very important.\nAn example of such a mechanism is to fairly rotate scholar-held SLP (presumed to be high velocity) to guild or protocol-held SLP. This could happen via guild-level games where scholars can stake/trade-in SLP for a chance at better cards or items, though the profitability of such a strategy to a guild is uncertain. Alternatively, the Axie Treasury could allocate AXS rewards for guilds performing community supporting initiatives which might include community-led burn mechanisms.\nAround 2:40 Brycent discusses a wager-based SLP burn that Lootsquad is working on.\nAn example of an existing community burn mechanism is YGG\u2019s commitment to staking its SLP treasury for RON or previously dedicating its SLP entirely to breeding new Axies.\nTakeaway: Seed and support communities with a culture of long-term supporting the game\nSolution 3. Build and Own Critical Infrastructure and Collect Fees as Sinks\nThis is an extension of taxes from part 1.\nP2E games can build, govern and monetize through owning core infrastructure and levying taxes on the usage of core infrastructure. Sky Mavis owns its own chain, marketplace, and DEX (Katana) and charges a gas cost (in RON) and a marketplace fee (4.25% of ETH) to use these protocols. These protocols all generate fees, which can then conduct buyback and burn, or taxes can be directly burnt as well.\nIt is arguably much easier for a p2e game studio to develop protocol infrastructure than try to inorganically bootstrap an ecosystem of games (strategy 2). If P2E economies are protocols, then the more protocol scope and coverage they can cover the more value accrual can emerge.\nBut in an open-source project and in the long term, high take rates are likely unsustainable. Only if the P2E game delivers the highest quality core infrastructure, incentivizes the best operators to contribute to their infrastructure (over building their own) can they justify critical infrastructure as a token sink or as a large revenue source for their treasury operations.\nTakeaway: Create the best critical infrastructure and collect fees as sinks or use protocol revenue for buyback and burn operations.\n\nConclusion\nA balance of faucets and sinks is required to maintain a healthy equilibrium of prices within a virtual economy. However, a sink never guarantees that any game-economy token will regain its ATHs. In fact, sinks only work if people use them.\nWeb2 games benefit from the fact that they are closed economies where once money enters it is difficult for it to leave (no in-game currency to USD exchange that is easy, transparent, and legal). This means they also benefit from a larger degree of separation of their currency from fiat in the minds of players. This means players\nHave no choice but to spend the money inside the platform/game\nAre less likely to conduct highly mathematical calculations in returns when engaging in any activity and are therefore\nMore likely to use currency for random things or for fun\nA p2e game does not enjoy these benefits. To encourage players to participate in sinks in an environment where the USD value of your inputs and outputs is extremely visible, it must offer either additional currency for burning (which further increases supply) or some other form of additional utility.\nAnd thus, in an open economy, only if the following equation holds will sinks be effective.\nMotivation + additional utility from using sink > cost of using a sink\n\nWhat determines the efficacy of the sink is whether people use it, and people will only use it if they see value in doing so.\n\n\u201cUltimately, people need to be spending for fun, status, convenience, flexing for the economics to work permanently\u201d \u2014 Jihoz\nWe are just at the beginning of understanding how to build out in the open.

I can\u2019t take this anymore man.  \nI\u2019ve still got to pay for my Christmas gifts! Those pesky corporations got me with the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d scheme. Was counting on the ARBI airdrop to handle the \u201cpay later\u201d part. What am I to do now?? Please devs send some ARBI soon! \nYes, I am exaggerating, but I would feel kinda cheated if I didn\u2019t get an Arbitrum airdrop. \nI know some of you would, too. \nOthers might be shaking their heads at my entitlement though. Crypto users have come to expect regular 4- to 5-figure airdrops, and plebs like me love them. \nBut are these airdrops justified in any way? Why do protocols do them, and what can they expect in return for giving out free tokens?\nThe usual reason is to reward early users. Or to further decentralize a protocol, which follows the ethos of crypto and can strengthen governance\n1.\nHowever, we want to focus on what a protocol can get in return for an airdrop. Is there any clear, tangible benefit to them? \nWe argue that there are several benefits; today, we will touch on two major ones: \nMarketing\nBootstrapping liquidity\nFollow along as we explore the good, bad, and ugly of crypto airdrops through these two lenses.  \nThanks for reading Espresso! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\nSubscribe\nThe Best Marketing Is Free Stuff\nFew things will get your protocol more \u201cairtime\u201d than giving users a juicy airdrop. \nEven the hint of free tokens kicks off a speculative frenzy that sets airdrop hunters on the trail. Thirsty crypto peeps will discuss the possibility of an airdrop for weeks or even months. Droves of users will check out your project and interact with it in the hope of getting some free tokens.\nIf you\u2019ve built a nice protocol, those users might stick around. \nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s review one of the greatest rivalries in DeFi: Uniswap and SushiSwap. \nBy 2020, Uniswap was a mainstay in DeFi. Usage, trading volumes, and total value locked (TVL) exploded that summer not only for Uniswap but across the board for all of DeFi. \nThen, on August 28, 2020, SushiSwap launched as a fork of Uniswap. \nTo bootstrap itself, the team promised liquidity providers heavy rewards in the form of SUSHI tokens if they moved their liquidity from Uniswap to SushiSwap. Lots of those liquidity providers made the switch. Traders followed, and Uniswap\u2019s TVL and trading volumes declined. \nUniswap didn\u2019t recover until it launched a token of its own on September 17, 2020.  \nUniswap\u2019s TVL stood at $915 million before the airdrop. One month later, it had risen more than three-fold to $2.9 billion. Trading volume more than doubled from $1.8 billion in September 2020 to $3.8 billion in March 2021.\n\nUniswap V2 TVL July-December 2020. Source: DefiLlama\nA great example of what protocols lacking an airdrop are missing out on would be all the OpenSea killers. \nRareGems, Portion, Foundation, and even well-capitalized exchanges like FTX and Coinbase tried to get in on the NFT craze. But they all went home empty-handed. \nThe only ones that had any semblance of success were LooksRare and X2Y2. \nBoth did an airdrop. \nBased on data from Sea Launch, X2Y2 has daily volumes of around 1,000 ETH, LooksRare 500-1,000 ETH. This is lower than OpenSea\u2019s daily volume of 7,000 ETH, but still significant. \nAll other Ethereum NFT marketplaces have negligible volume in comparison. \nThe thing is, it\u2019s not as simple as just dropping a token at whatever rate you want. There needs to be some strategy regarding how you drop it. \nWhat better way to understand this than a dive into tokens that provide limited value to the user? \nTime for some meme economics.\nLeader of the Pack\nIn the old days, protocols used to distribute tokens at launch via initial coin offerings (ICOs), which helped to decentralize a project. But since ICOs went the way of the dodo, these days when a token launches, only insiders hold the token. \nThat means that the protocol needs to generate demand from other investors or retail (i.e., they need heads to dump on). It\u2019s that, or insiders will be left trading against one another. \nSay you launch a token and fund a liquidity pool to create a market. If it\u2019s just you and your buddies dumping into that pool, the token price will take the fast train to goblin town. There is no unsuspecting degen on the other side of that pool absorbing your token\u2019s freefall in price.\nAirdrops help generate this missing piece.\nAn example of this can be seen in dog meme tokens on Solana. They show us how airdropping a large percentage of tokens can make a market healthy. \nIn crypto, meme tokens command similar and even higher valuations than \u201clegit\u201d projects. Dog meme tokens fare particularly well for some reason. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have the 8th- and 16th-highest market caps in crypto, respectively. \nNo wonder then that in every chain there\u2019s a slew of \u201cdog tokens,\u201d each trying to become the DOGE of their own little kingdom. \nSolana is no different. It has no fewer than 10 dog coins, from Woof to Solana Inu. There are even \u201ccat coins\u201d such as Kitty Coin Solana or CATO and other random meme tokens. \nBut no Solana meme token, dog or otherwise, was as successful as Samoyedcoin (SAMO). \nAt its peak, SAMO had a market cap of over $700 million. It\u2019s now down to $12 million. But that\u2019s still much better than the $900,000 market cap of WOOF, the second-biggest Solana meme token. \nWhat made SAMO more successful than the rest of the Solana dog pack?\nAll these meme tokens had silly, dog-related names, big marketing campaigns, and funny logos. \nWhat was SAMO\u2019s secret recipe?\nA massive", "doc_id": "235fe34d-7437-476a-a0c3-961d4befb7f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c5ba24505da8a10078134137572c5291e7a68a7318cef18ae54d7dd9658e8c45", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 332378, "end": 346458}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "e6892184-3e2d-4cc6-b6f6-2134989a4810", "3": "f9021a39-dcac-4684-85af-b04152214278"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9021a39-dcac-4684-85af-b04152214278": {"text": "is no different.

Source: samoyedcoin.com\nThe airdrop made up 14.4% of the initial supply. The thing is, the team later burnt 66.1% of all supply. That meant a whopping 42% of all circulating tokens were airdropped to users all around Solana. \nThis airdrop was orders of magnitude bigger than the airdrops that other Solana meme tokens did. SolDoge (SDOGE) airdropped 2% of the supply. Solabrador (SOLAB) a mere 0.16%. \nWhat do their charts look like? And, more important, how do they stack up against SAMO?\n\nSource: CoinGecko\nSOLAB had a mini-pump at the start of last year and has been down-trending ever since. \nSDOGE didn\u2019t even manage that. \n\nSource: CoinGecko\nSolDoge\u2019s very launch marked its all-time high. It dropped like a stone thereafter and has been languishing all year. \nSAMO\u2019s chart looks remarkably healthy in comparison. \n\nSource: CoinGecko\nSAMO launched in May 2021, and after a bout of volatility, it rallied through the end of the year. It topped in November 2021, like about every other risk asset out there, and has been on a downtrend since. \nIt did manage to rally a bit after June 2022, as did other crypto assets. Other Solana meme tokens didn\u2019t join in that rally at all.\nEven now, SAMO has a trading volume of over $300,000 a day. SBAR\u2019s trading volume stands at $75.65, SDOGE\u2019s at $35.62. The cost of about 6 Big Macs. That\u2019s a dead market if I ever saw one. \nBy airdropping a large percentage of the supply, the SAMO team made sure that the market was not dominated by insiders. For a meme token that exists just for laughs, that is paramount. \nAnd a new player in the Solana meme token arena seems to have learnt the lesson from SAMO. \nI am talking about Bonk Inu (BONK), of course, the most recent flavor\u2026 I mean dog breed of the day in crypto. \nA silly meme token with a website that has three buttons and a couple of images. \nGuess what the token\u2019s differentiating trait was (aside from the Bonk meme). \nYou guessed it, a juicy airdrop. From their website: \nThe Bonk contributors were tired of toxic \u201cAlameda\u201d tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot. \n50% of all supply was airdropped among several groups, including the holders of the top 40 NFT collections on Solana (20%), NFT artists and collectors (10%), traders (15%), and Solana devs (5%). \n\nBonk Inu (BONK) token distribution. Source: bonkcoin.com\nBONK launched on December 10, 2021, and is now the hottest Solana meme coin with a market cap of $200 million and a fully diluted value (FDV) of $420 million. I\u2019d add a price chart but it\u2019s literally just a straight line up.\nNot bad for a 1-month old dog coin. \nWe even saw something similar with Uniswap and SushiSwap. These two projects had a successful protocol backing their airdrops, so the ability to retain value in the token was easier.\nThe lesson seems clear: An initial airdrop helps bootstrap liquidity and leads to a healthier market from the get-go. It\u2019s the best form of marketing a project can ask for.\nIt\u2019s Arbitrum\u2019s Turn\nIf there are any Arbitrum devs among the readers, it should be obvious to you now that you really should do an airdrop. \nNot only to finance my Christmas buying spree. But also because your main competitor already did so. While their success can be debated, the chance to do better is squarely in your court. \nYou see, Arbitrum is not the only Ethereum L2 solution. Another one is Optimism. \nBoth launched roughly at the same time, and both are optimistic rollups. We won\u2019t get into the tech here\n2; suffice to say they are both similar solutions for Ethereum scaling, and they are trying to court the same devs, users, and protocols.\nFor one reason or another, Arbitrum had the upper hand for much of 2021. It had more interesting dApps developing on it, more users, and more transactions per day. \nThis all changed over the summer, as Optimism launched an airdrop followed by liquidity incentives. Now, the gap between the two chains has shrunk. \nOptimism\u2019s TVL stayed between $200-$400 million all through 2021 and until summer 2022. \nAfter the airdrop and liquidity incentives, Optimism\u2019s TVL jumped to $1 billion. It has come down to $500 million since, and is the seventh chain/roll-up by TVL. \n\nOptimism TVL. Source: DefiLlama.\nArbitrum\u2019s TVL by contrast has been down-trending from its all-time high of $3 billion. It now sits at around $1 billion.\nARBI devs, if you want to make sure Optimism does not take the crown away from you, consider doing an airdrop with distributions that mimic some of the insights earlier. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the TVL figures react as this new asset is introduced to its economy.\nOh, and don\u2019t forget the utility. Without a true purpose to the token, I\u2019ll look to pay off those Christmas gifts by selling the token immediately upon receipt.\nAnd because you\u2019re probably asking yourself this question, yes, feel free to reach out to us to help you design that ARBI airdrop using the \u201ccontact us\u201d form on this page.\nKeep it fun,\nKodi\n1\nFor a thorough analysis of the Uniswap airdrop and other DeFi airdrops that explores their role in decentralization, governance and rewarding users, do read this excellent piece.\n2\nIf you want to learn more about it, check out Arbitrum\u2019s and Optimism\u2019s documentation.\n\u2014----------------------\n\nne vs. Two Token\nModels in Crypto Gaming\nAnd a potential new model unifying the two\nBY NAT ELIASON\nMAY 27, 2022\n\u2665 15\n Listen\nWhether to use a one or two token model is among the most common questions I get from teams designing their crypto game\u2019s economy. \nMy default response until recently was always to use two tokens, but now I\u2019ve been rethinking that advice. I think you can make a compelling case for either choice, and I\u2019m going to try to explain some of that nuance here. There also may be a way to get the best of both worlds, as I walk through at the end.\nThis article will primarily focus on gaming, though you could apply similar thoughts to other crypto projects. Gaming is a nice sandbox to think this through in though since it allows for so much more token utility than other projects. \nAnyway, let\u2019s dive in. \nWhat\u2019s a Token For?\nThe primary use of a token in a crypto game should be to improve the game economy in some way that is not possible without a token. \nTokens are used for many other things like speculation, but as I explained in my \u201ccrypto gaming is broken\u201d article, those other uses can end up hurting the quality or future of the game.\nSo how can a token improve the game economy in some new way? I believe this primarily occurs through closing the loop on microtransactions. Instead of a one-way street where players make microtransactions to unlock some additional utility in the game, crypto tokens enable a two-way street where players can also pull some of the value of their work out of the game. They allow those who have invested significant time into the game to trade that time for capital, and they allow people with capital a new way to trade some of that capital for saved time. \nThese transactions can take two forms:\nApplication Transactions: Where players are paying the game itself for access to something like a battle pass, cosmetic, loot box key, or progression in the game. \nPeer-to-Peer Transactions: Where players are paying each other for resources within the game. These could be NFTs, currencies, or anything else. \nThose transactions have existed in games for a long time. We\u2019re all familiar with in-game transactions and auction houses. The one crucial difference a token enables is the ability to create a liquid market between the game and \u201creal money.\u201d A way for the player to redeem their Runescape gold for dollars (with a couple of extra steps). \nAny other utilities, in my mind, are secondary. Not that the other utilities don\u2019t exist, but this should always be the primary value of introducing a crypto token to a game. \nSo what are those other utilities? Fundraising is a big one. Speculation another. Governance can be one as well. You could also include cash flows or ownership too, as a more serious version of speculation. But we need to recognize that tokens are often introduced not to make the game better, but as a way to help fund the game. And then the question is if this can be done in a way that also benefits the game and community, or if it always ends up being at odds with creating a good game. \nSince the two token model is more common right now, let\u2019s start there. \nThe Two Token Model\nThe two token model was pioneered by Axie Infinity with their AXS \u201cgovernance\u201d token and their SLP \u201cin-game\u201d token. \nAXS is the fixed supply token that\u2019s meant to accrue value over time, and SLP is an infinite supply token they can mint and burn as needed to balance out the game. \nIn this model, AXS is essentially a security. It\u2019s akin to holding stock in the Axie game. Teams can\u2019t really say this, of course, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing. Governance is often just a way to feign utility to get around the security concerns. SLP is the real \u201cgame\u201d token, since it\u2019s what most of the game economy runs on. \nBenefits to the Two Token Model\nWhat\u2019s great with this model is you can split out the speculation and the game economy. When you launch anything in crypto, people will speculate on it to try to get a nice fast return. Having one token where people can speculate and one token where people can play the game lets these two uses play out separately so that a surge in speculation doesn\u2019t cause a surge in the in-game prices. You don\u2019t want a surge in speculation to suddenly drive up the price of everything in the game. \nIt also makes fundraising easier. Investors want a fixed supply token they can invest in that has some reason to go up in value over time. A variable supply in-game currency isn\u2019t a great investment asset since the game creators can adjust the emissions, burns, and utility of the token at any time. And they might need to try to push its value in one direction or another to balance out the game. \nThe two token model of this type is also familiar. People are used to seeing two tokens from Axie and other games that have followed its model, so they intuitively \u201cget\u201d that there\u2019s one token for speculating and one token for playing. It\u2019s also similar to how we think about normal money, like how Gold or Bitcoin is the asset you hold, and Dollars are the asset you spend. \nDownsides to the Two Token Model\nWhile a game is surging in popularity and the market is hot, a two token model looks perfect. One token is staying fairly steady for people to play the game with, and the other one is steadily going up to give people that NGU speculation euphoria. \nBut when the music stops or slows, people will start to wonder: what\u2019s the point of this governance token exactly? It\u2019s unlikely people will sit on millions of dollars of game tokens just to vote on governance measures. There needs to be more. \nThis question of \u201cwhat is the point of the Fixed Supply Token?\u201d is the big downside of the Two Token Model. So there are a few ways to solve it:\nWhat is the Fixed Supply Token For?\nHave a purely speculative Fixed Supply Token (FST) eventually leads to the \u201chey why are we holding this?\u201d question. Speculation can\u2019t keep the price up forever, so there has to be some point to the token.\nSome teams will take the approach of adding cashflows, typically via staking. This can go two routes: \nDilution Protection: You stake your token for more of the same token. This isn\u2019t really cash flow, it\u2019s just dilution protection as more tokens get unlocked. But it still looks like \u201cfree money\u201d at least. \nDividends: Stakers receive some other token representing the spending in the game. This is tough to get right though, because if you redistribute funds collected via Application Transactions, then the transactions that should be acting as sinks to pull the currency out of the economy stop acting as sinks. They turn ponzinomic instead. So you really only want to redistribute fees from Peer to Peer transactions. \nDividends from Peer to Peer transactions could be quite significant, too. STEPN was making 2-3m a day in transaction fees for much of the past month. There were 600m GMT tokens circulating, so let\u2019s assume 1/2 of those would get staked if they had staking. If they split their transaction fees with GMT holders 50/50, then there would be $1m a day going to 300m GMT staked or about .3 cents per token per day. Given the average GMT price of $1.50 over the last month, that\u2019s a 0.2% per day dividend, or 73% non-dilutive APR. That\u2019s incredible! They didn\u2019t do this, but it does show that dividends on peer-to-peer transactions can be significant. \nIf a team doesn\u2019t want to add cash flows, or if they want to add something in addition to cash flows, they will add in-game utility for the fixed supply token. \nThis is what Axie ended up doing, by introducing AXS costs for breeding. In that case, the FST becomes an additional in-game currency, with the difference being that it is a fixed supply vs. the other token\u2019s infinite supply. Game designers can choose whether they want these used tokens to be burned or recirculated, and use that as an additional check on the game economy. \nUtility for the FST gets tricky though. What do you use the FST for vs the VST (Variable Supply Token)? \nYou could draw the", "doc_id": "f9021a39-dcac-4684-85af-b04152214278", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7383b23574ef3d3a18f3b3b526a4955ac09c15f9e4122f5d3091a18aacaf023b", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 346554, "end": 360548}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "235fe34d-7437-476a-a0c3-961d4befb7f9", "3": "5ca905db-1a02-44d5-8aea-68b6bb7238e6"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ca905db-1a02-44d5-8aea-68b6bb7238e6": {"text": "do this, but it does show that dividends on peer-to-peer transactions can be significant. \nIf a team doesn\u2019t want to add cash flows, or if they want to add something in addition to cash flows, they will add in-game utility for the fixed supply token. \nThis is what Axie ended up doing, by introducing AXS costs for breeding.

What do you use the FST for vs the VST (Variable Supply Token)? \nYou could draw the line anywhere, but it typically ends up being somewhat arbitrary. There are good arguments for using either as the marketplace token, and for either as the app transaction token. \nI think if teams are going to add utility for the FST, then that utility should have some impact on the token\u2019s supply. The point of adding utility is to drive value to the FST, but if it\u2019s just being used as a currency like the VST, then there\u2019s no utility to holding it. You can just buy it as you need it, and sell it when you don\u2019t. But if the FST gets burned when it\u2019s used on special upgrades in the game, for example, then both the FST token and the assets that have those upgrades should get more valuable over time as the game gets more popular. \nTeams taking the two-token route will eventually run into this problem though. Unless they find a way to add value or utility to the FST, it will get dumped, and a lot of speculators will be left holding the bag. \nSo what if they try a one token model?\nThe One Token Model\nUsing just one token has been tried much less. But it offers some promise as a way to resolve the issues of the two-token model. \nOne thing worth keeping in mind is that a one token model doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s only one currency in the game. The game could have many currencies, but only have one that acts as the bridge between the game and crypto. \nThere are a few ways this could be done.\nA VST One Token Model\nOne option is to create a one token model with just a variable supply token. I haven\u2019t seen a good example of this yet, but it makes sense as a token model for a game trying to strictly follow some of the ideas I had in the \u201ccrypto gaming is broken piece.\u201d\nIt goes back to my point at the start of this article. The purpose of a crypto asset in a game is for people to be able to trade their in-game work for out-of-game money. \nIf a game studio wanted to do this without messing with complicated tokenomics, here\u2019s an extremely simple method. \nBuild an awesome game with an in-game marketplace (e.g. Runescape, WoW, etc.) \nCreate a bridge between the core currency and the blockchain\nAdd liquidity for that currency with another token (ETH, USDC, etc)\nThere, you\u2019re done. You made a crypto game. This is deceptively simple but it\u2019s all we need in many cases. Imagine Runescape with a highly liquid Gold <> USDC market. That would be pretty awesome, right? \nYou don\u2019t even need to make the items NFTs, because let\u2019s be honest, the game items are worthless without the game. Just keep the normal Auction House where players can trade everything for gold, add a gold bridge, and boom, awesome crypto game. \nWhy haven\u2019t we seen this? Well, because making fun games is extremely hard. There are games that are taking this approach, most of them just aren\u2019t out yet. And when they come out it\u2019s going to be much harder for them to gain traction because they won\u2019t have an exciting ponzinomic loop on top of them. And if we\u2019re being honest, those breeding ponzi loops are an excellent go-to-market strategy for drumming up initial hype. \nThe other downside of this model is that there\u2019s no token for people to speculate on. And at least for now, succeeding in crypto does seem to require having some opportunity for speculation. It\u2019s also hard to raise money from investors without some fixed supply asset they can hold on to for the long term with some hopes of its value going up. \nSo let\u2019s consider a Fixed Supply One Token Model next.\nA Fixed Supply One Token Model\nCould you build a crypto game where there\u2019s just a fixed supply token? This is the route some of the older crypto gaming platforms that launched took, like Sandbox and Decentraland. And I think we might see it become popular again as an improvement on the two token model. \nHere\u2019s one way you might do it. This is somewhat speculative and I\u2019m still workshopping it, so please don\u2019t just copy & paste it and assume it will work.\nIn this model, you have your fixed supply token which serves as the investable asset as well as the bridge for all in-game money.\nBut you still need a more variable supply currency in the game so you can balance the economy better. So you still have the VST, it\u2019s just locked in the game without a bridge.\nThen you create an in-game DEX between the VST and FST, as well as among any other in-game assets. This is actually a much better technology for trading something like wood for gold, since it creates a SushiSwap or Uniswap style liquid market for being able to immediately trade anything without needing a buyer on the other side. \nSo players could exchange Gold for the FST at any time and bridge out the FST. Or they could bridge in the FST to buy Gold and Wood and whatever else they want. \nSince the FST has a fixed supply, and all the items in the game would be inflationary, the purchasing power of the FST should increase over time without being extractive. Early players would be rewarded with the fruits of their labor being more valuable in FST terms, but later players will still be able to Play and Earn. \nThen separate from the resource marketplace, you could have an item marketplace. These items could be extractable as NFTs, or they could be locked in the game. I don\u2019t think it makes a big difference. You could price everything in the marketplace in the FST, and then take a transaction fee either into the treasury or as a burn. If you burn it, then you create some deflation over time, which would also help drive more value to the FST. \nAnother option is to price the item marketplace in a major crypto asset like ETH. The huge benefit here is that then the transaction fees are in an asset that is not tied to the game performance. If you charge a transaction fee on your own token, you still have to sell that token into the market to have revenue. If you charge a transaction fee on ETH or SOL or USDC, then you have that revenue immediately. \nThis also requires players to bridge another asset like ETH, SOL, or USDC into the game, which would be stored by the treasury. The treasury could earn yield on these assets while custodying them, creating an additional income stream for the game. \nThe question then is, how does the FST derive value? Here you could reintroduce the dividend model, but where the dividend is paid in the asset being used in the marketplace. So by staking my FST, I\u2019m earning some ETH or USDC in the game, without having to bother with some complicated on-chain staking system. This would be extremely cool and is not something I\u2019ve seen any game try. Though I suppose it would be complicated legally. \nThen you could also have it accrue some dividends from the trading fees on all the other swaps. So by locking up your tokens in the game, you\u2019re earning some ETH, some of the in-game VST, and some more of the FST, all from the different trades happening in the game. That would make it a phenomenal investment asset, and you\u2019d be increasing the value of the FST over time by having its purchasing power for the inflationary assets increase. If you threw some high-value burns on top of it, you\u2019d have an extremely strong investment thesis for the token. \nAs I think through this model, I think it\u2019s much stronger than the current popular two token models. It adds a lot of flexibility and ensures there\u2019s one core asset that\u2019s accruing value in the ecosystem. The VST one-token model is ideal if you just want to build a game that has some crypto tie-in. But this FST model lets you retain some of the more speculative side of crypto, as well as the investability over time. \nThis is purely a thought exercise and definitely needs some refining. But I hope it\u2019s helpful for any team trying to think through how to structure their tokenomics. I\u2019ll keep referring to this and expanding on it as I explore more games, and work with more teams. \nAnd as always, if you\u2019re working on a game and want to collaborate on figuring this out, hit me up on Twitter.\n\u2014------------------------------\n\nToken Design for Serious People\n\nLucas Baker\n\nNihar Shah\nResearchEconomics\nJul 07 2022 _ 17 min read\n\nTL;DR\nWe offer guiding principles for protocol designers looking to create sustainable token economic models (aka tokenomics).\nTokenomics should: (i) provide common goods that private participants could not access without coordination, and (ii) reward those who create value rather than extract or transfer value.\nWe use this framework to analyze some common tokenomic models: gas fees, validator staking, (3,3) staking, governance, and play-to-earn.\nIntroduction\nWith the onset of crypto winter, developers, investors, and community members alike have a chance to step back and reassess their perspectives. This reset is especially welcome when it comes to token design, i.e. \"tokenomics.\" For the last two years, many protocols have built tokenomic models that increasingly incentivize short-term outcomes over long-term sustainability. OlympusDAO\u2019s 8,000% APY on OHM tokens and Bored Apes Yacht Club\u2019s non-productive lockups of APE tokens (called out by Cobie) are just two of the more prominent examples of what cropped up during the last bull market.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t have to be so for the next wave of crypto. The calm of winter can allow builders to craft well-grounded token designs. In turn, those designs can deliver sustainable outcomes for the next generation of protocols.\nThis piece offers a perspective for designers. In particular, we argue that protocol tokens should follow two basic design principles:\nTokenomics should coordinate common goods that participants would struggle to provide efficiently and economically on their own.\nTokenomics should channel value towards those who create that value, prioritizing value distribution (aligned with value creation) towards high-utility groups over value transfer between participants.\nSimilar to our framing of Yield Farming, these design principles are based on the fundamental idea of a rational and value-maximizing economic exchange. There are no free lunches, and short-term gimmicks often come at the cost of enduring value. Builders and participants alike should look for designs that clearly create and distribute fundamental value, and be skeptical towards those that do not.\nWhat is Tokenomics?\nThe word \"tokenomics\" is as catchy as it is vaguely defined. Operationally, it is an all-encompassing term to include all of the following design categories:\nInitial supply and allocation to team, investors, community, and other stakeholders\nMethods of distribution including token purchases, airdrops, grants, and partnerships\nRevenue split between users, service providers, and protocol\nTreasury size, structure, and intended uses\nEmission schedule including inflation, mint/burn rights, and supply caps\nCoin governance including voting, escrow, stake-weighting, vesting, and gauges\nMiner and validator compensation such as fees, emissions, and penalties\nUsage of protocol\u2019s native tokens versus external tokens (e.g. ETH, USDC)\nFor the purpose of this piece, we will treat \"tokenomics\" as the distribution of token-based incentives, i.e. what should be rewarded and how to reward it. We will focus not on individual and operational questions, but on definitional first principles. It is focused on developing the underlying framework for tokenomics in the abstract. From these first principles, protocol designers can answer each question based on the most pressing tradeoffs and concerns for their particular products.\nWhile this piece may not provide the quick fixes that time-strapped builders are looking for, we think the journey is worthwhile. During the bull market, too many protocols \u2014 almost by default \u2014 used their tokens for one overriding purpose: to solve the \"cold start\" problem of usage and awareness. In doing so, these protocols offered high (and at times outrageous) rewards without considering whether this was sustainable or in its long-term interests.\nThe cold start problem is real, and we believe that some of a good tokenomics model must address it. But by returning to the foundations, we can understand this as one among several competing priorities. A good tokenomics model, grounded in strong design principles, will handle them in a balanced and sustainable way.\n\nPrinciple 1: Provide Common Goods\nThe first core principle of a robust tokenomic model is the ability to deliver common goods (and avoid common \"bads\").[1] A good design should solve collective action problems, organizing and incentivizing its participants to provide services collectively that could not be generated from individual behavior.\nTo make this concrete, consider the simple example of staking. Without a reward system, no participant would want to secure the network (i.e. bear uncompensated costs singlehandedly to provide diffuse benefits). But with a reward system (typically emissions or fees paid to \"stakers\"), that decision-making changes. Participants stake for reasons that are individually rational, but \u2014 in the aggregate \u2014 they provide benefits that are enjoyed by all.\nThe motivation for common goods in crypto is the same as the one behind taxpayer-funded goods and services such as mass transit, national defense, or public schools. In both cases, a well-designed common good generally has the following properties:\nPositive net utility: total benefits for the community as a whole exceed total costs.\nInability to privatize: providing the good is uneconomical for individuals privately, due to direct costs and coordination costs.\n\nPrinciple 2: Align Rewards with Value Creation\nThe second core principle of a robust tokenomic model is the ability to compensate individuals proportional to the value created (and destroyed). In other words, a good design generates a clear and salient link between actions and rewards to maximize incentives to create value.\nAt a high level, the compensation (and penalties) to any actor in the system can theoretically be broken into two components: aligned (what they get for providing value) and non-aligned (anything else). For instance, slashing a dishonest validator\u2019s stake would be aligned because the cost is linked to the change (in this case, loss) in value. By contrast, giving a large token bonus to a random validator would be non-aligned, because no value was provided to justify the", "doc_id": "5ca905db-1a02-44d5-8aea-68b6bb7238e6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "445c3424afd1eff3ad148ab485a3aaf2893cca565097b543d8601417f58dced7", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 360470, "end": 375524}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "f9021a39-dcac-4684-85af-b04152214278", "3": "f98694d4-9e9e-4ff4-979d-042a685501c2"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98694d4-9e9e-4ff4-979d-042a685501c2": {"text": "and coordination costs.\n\nPrinciple 2: Align Rewards with Value Creation\nThe second core principle of a robust tokenomic model is the ability to compensate individuals proportional to the value created (and destroyed). In other words, a good design generates a clear and salient link between actions and rewards to maximize incentives to create value.\nAt a high level, the compensation (and penalties) to any actor in the system can theoretically be broken into two components: aligned (what they get for providing value) and non-aligned (anything else). For instance, slashing a dishonest validator\u2019s stake would be aligned because the cost is linked to the change (in this case, loss) in value. By contrast, giving a large token bonus to a random validator would be non-aligned, because no value was provided to justify the award.\nWhile this is straightforward in theory, it is more complex in practice. First, often several parties are jointly responsible for any interaction within the system, and attribution is not always measurable. Second, many critical actions have distant payoffs (e.g. allocating community grants, entering into long-term partnerships, etc), making it difficult to create clear incentives upfront. Nevertheless, we believe this is a key principle for which protocol builders should strive.\nMoreover, there is a strong link between aligned compensation and long-term value maximization. When protocol designers have the choice between optimizing short-term target metrics and long-term utility, two trends emerge in practice:\nAlignment is healthy: Aligned compensation incentivizes risk \u2014 or cost-bearing commitments and other forms of longer-term investment. Conversely, non-aligned compensation encourages mercenary capital which often preserves maximum freedom to exit. For example, \"farm-dumping\" \u2014 where reward tokens are immediately sold \u2014 demonstrates non-alignment in yield farming.\nDistortion is costly: Design mechanisms that do not align compensation tend to destroy long-term value, especially when interacting with feedback loops. For instance, giving artificially high rewards to holders of an NFT collection may kick off a speculative run that reverses brutally once the rewards are exhausted \u2014 possibly destroying the perceived value of the collection.\n\nEvaluating Current Designs\nSo far, we have defined our principles in the abstract, but how do they apply to real-world examples? We examine a series of common and concrete tokenomic designs to see how they fare.\nGas Fees\nGas fees are the canonical example of sound crypto-economic design, exemplifying our two principles perfectly.[2] To illustrate, first imagine a blockchain without gas fees. In this scenario, participants face no cost to submitting low-quality transactions (pure spam, in the extreme) that crowd out high-quality and high-priority transactions. At the same time, miners and validators are not rewarded for their computational efforts to process transactions.\nGas fees are thus critical, as we would expect. To evaluate them on our core principles:\nCommon good: Yes. Gas fees defend the system from low-quality or resource-intensive transactions that would otherwise make the chain slow or unusable for high-quality transactions. Moreover, fees serve as a coordinating mechanism for participants to coordinate tacitly on relative transaction priority.\nValue alignment: Yes. Compensation is aligned because fees are paid directly from participants, who impose computational costs on the system; and to miners, who provide the computational power necessary for the chain to function.\nFees can be split and optimized in many ways. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s EIP-1559 reduces deadweight loss by introducing a base/priority system that allows users to contest relative priority within a block while minimizing impact on the price of the lowest-priority transaction. (Ethereum has historically had high and variable gas fees, which complicates users\u2019 decisions.) However, all reasonable variants of the gas system accomplish the key objectives of providing common goods and aligning rewards with value creation.\nValidator Staking\nIn proof-of-stake systems, validator staking (and slashing) is another canonical example of good tokenomic design.[3] As before, imagine a blockchain without staking. In this scenario, validators face no penalty for compromising the chain\u2019s security, such as by failing to flag invalid transactions. Given the weakened security, users do not use the network \u2014 and the chain is rendered useless.\nStaking is thus similarly essential, and can be analyzed under the two core principles:\nCommon good: Yes. Staking delivers security to the chain, making it usable to the community. Without such mechanisms, private participants would not be incentivized to provide security, as the costs are direct and the benefits are diffuse. Moreover, staking is a coordinating mechanism for the network to agree on the relative importance of validators.\nValue alignment: Yes. Compensation is aligned for good actors as described above. Moreover, inept or malicious validators forfeit their stakes to the rest of the community as the penalty for weakening security.\nDelegated staking shares these same properties. For instance, a user staking Solana on a centralized exchange still contributes to the chain\u2019s security, because the exchange remains motivated to direct its tokens to high-quality validators who will preserve capital.\nWhile staking remains an effective mechanism, there is still room for improvement. In particular, staking is commonly done entirely in the chain\u2019s native token. In extreme cases, this runs the risk of a \"doom loop\" where a fall in the token\u2019s price leads to reduced security, which leads to a further fall in the token\u2019s price, etc. (See, for instance, the preemptive halting of the Terra chain on May 12 after the fall in LUNA\u2019s price sparked concerns around the ease of an attack.) In such cases, staking would fail to deliver the common good and align value correctly.\n\n(3, 3) and Non-Restrictive \"Staking\"\nGas fees and validator staking succeed at aligning value on two sides, rewarding good behavior and imposing costs for nonproductive or malicious behavior. In contrast, many of the non-restrictive \"staking\" rewards currently offered by DeFi protocols neither require users to provide value directly nor ask them for any form of behavioral commitment. The most prominent example is OlympusDAO (and its many imitators), which introduced a \"rebase\" every eight hours to issue more OHM tokens to staked OHM tokens (sOHM) as long as the backing treasury would support it. While technically locked, sOHM could be unlocked at any point by forfeiting a single rebase\u2019s worth of rewards, making it effectively \"OHM with an interest rate.\"\nAs many traders will remember, Olympus rocketed to prominence in late 2021 with outlandish APYs (at times rising over 8000%), and attracted capital investments of nearly $5 billion at its peak. The meteoric rise and fall in token price \u2014 from $200 to $1300 to $17 \u2014 was striking even for crypto. Were these dynamics simply the unavoidable consequence of a speculative environment?\nPerhaps, but we offer an alternative hypothesis: the staking mechanism was insufficiently focused on common goods and value alignment. Instead, the mechanism was focused on value transfer from non-stakers to stakers. Let\u2019s see how it does on design principles:\nCommon good: Minimal. This form of staking arguably creates two common goods \u2014 liquidity and marketing \u2014 but at excessive and unsustainable levels. Regarding liquidity, the staking contributed to \"protocol-owned liquidity,\" which allowed the protocol to receive fees for providing liquidity to AMM pools. However, the need for this common resource is questionable, since users can provide liquidity to pools directly.[4] Regarding marketing, the high returns attracted plenty of attention, which is valuable to the extent that attention translates into sustained activity, enhancing the long-term value of the protocol. However, the protocol\u2019s high rewards crowded out all other initiatives, making it harmful in the aggregate.\nValue alignment: No. While moderate (e.g. two digit) rewards could be justified for providing liquidity and marketing, the rewards were massive (four digits). Thus, this mechanism was primarily redistributive in practice, resulting primarily in a value transfer from non-stakers to stakers.\nWe can also use this lens to understand Cobie\u2019s critique against the Bored Ape Yacht Club for rewarding non-productive \"staking.\" The rewards provided were unlikely to stimulate any real, value-providing use cases, and mostly looked like a way of letting early investors cash out. In prioritizing value transfer (from long-term and passive participants to short-term and extractive ones) over value creation, the mechanism weakened the long-term foundations of the protocol.\n\nGovernance\nWith the difference between productive and non-productive staking in mind, we can look at the more complex design space of token-based governance. Governance should be a fertile design space given the importance of decentralization and broad participation in crypto, but the governance models of most protocols are both simple and highly similar.[5] In fact, most protocol governance can be explained as a combination of two key design choices. Firstly, nearly all protocols follow the rule of \"one coin, one vote\" (and we\u2019ve written about our concerns with this model before). Secondly, \"ve\" (vote escrow) models, which give locked tokens more voting power than unlocked tokens, have become increasingly popular as a means of empowering long-term holders. How do these models score on our design principles?\nCommon good: Yes. Governance models undeniably create strong common benefits. Firstly, governance models act as coordinating mechanisms enabling diffuse communities to commit to clear actions. Secondly, community-driven models allow protocols to be more flexible and adaptive to changing conditions than they could with hard-coded rules. Finally, community-driven governance can credibly lower the risk of expropriation to builders relative to centralized governance.[6]\nValue alignment: Minimal. Despite creating tremendous common benefits, most governance models perform surprisingly poorly in giving that value back to those who generate it. For instance, voters are usually not rewarded for good decisions and punished for bad decisions; in fact, voters are often not even rewarded for participating over non-voters.[7] To the extent that reward markets (a.k.a. bribes) exist, they incentivize the success of any proposal, whether beneficial or harmful.\nOn the topic of value alignment, we also note that those who create, research, and steer successful governance proposals typically go unrewarded for their efforts. While there are some innovations (e.g. Vitalik\u2019s discussion of \"skin in the game\" systems that link long-term outcomes to votes), these are largely hypothetical. The rare exception is the ve model, which better links long-term rewards to governing choices today.[8] This is typically accomplished via lockup a la Curve, but can also occur via non-locking vesting that reverses if liquidity is removed.\nVote escrow notwithstanding, coin governance as a whole is overdue for innovation. There are indeed some efforts to make progress on mitigating the Sibyl attack and better linking votes to identity, e.g. proof-of-personhood systems (as discussed by Fred Ehrsam), pseudonym parties (as discussed by Siddarth et al (2020)), and \"web of trust\" solutions (ditto). There are also efforts to augment vote escrow models to link voting rights to long-term stakes more efficiently (as discussed by Ong and Reucassel). Future protocol designers should consider this expanded arsenal when designing governance, and experiment with more robust tokenomic designs.\n\nPlay-to-Earn\nPlay-to-earn is where tokenized ownership meets game mechanics, and at first blush should be naturally suited to value alignment, but the reality is more complicated. Compared to traditional games, crypto gaming protocols offer the potential for more sophisticated in-game economies with a broad range of liquid and tradable assets. \"Play-to-earn\" is a way to distribute ownership of that economy, via token-denominated rewards for participation. In mid-February, for instance, players could earn between $10-$50 per day on Axie Infinity, through a combination of direct rewards for gameplay and additional luck-based rewards (e.g. breeding a rare Axie).\nIn the last few months, however, many play-to-earn models have come under financial pressure and scrutiny alike. The tokens in the Axie Infinity protocol, for instance, are down over 85% from mid-February as of writing, severely compressing earnings potential. Token value aside, how does the play-to-earn model perform on our two key principles?\nCommon good: Moderate. In theory, play-to-earn models can help the game solve the \"cold start\" problem, when the game requires some critical mass (or strength of network effects) to be fun for a general audience. Without an incentive mechanism, games such as MMOs may be unable to attract initial participants, condemning even good games to failure. However, an ideal model would reward early players only until critical mass was achieved. In practice, play-to-earn models usually dispense more valuable rewards as momentum accumulates and price rises (often driven by asset scarcity). At this point, the rewards simply transfer value from the protocol to players, boosting short-term usage at the expense of long-term sustainability.\nValue alignment: Moderate. Again, in theory, play-to-earn models share rewards with early participants, who provide value by playing the game before it is compelling enough on its own. However, most play-to-earn games transfer value to early participants regardless of whether they contribute to the game community. This lack of alignment benefits short-term actors and distorts the community\u2019s growth.\nThe primary issue with play-to-earn as currently implemented is the efficiency of value distribution, in the sense of aligned rewards over total rewards. Broadly, the ideal mechanism to reward early community builders would reward only actions that make the game more enjoyable for all, only when they are needed to build critical mass, and only for ongoing contributions.[9]\nOf course, problems can be more subtle \u2014 but the same principles apply. For instance, if a game\u2019s current mechanics attract low-skilled players primarily, designers could focus on rewarding skill in each match (e.g. larger rewards for beating better players) rather than rewarding the number of matches played. If the problem is early stakeholders collecting an outsize share of rewards when token price rises, designers could tie rewards to some global activity metric. Finally, if the cold start problem is the most critical, rewards could taper. More specifically, a web3 game developer could let the first thousand players for a new game lock in a boosted reward rate for the initial weeks, with smaller rewards for later weeks or later players.\nWhile play-to-earn is the clearest example of the challenges in value alignment, the preceding discussion also applies to any \"X-to-earn\" where rewards are distributed for specific actions. Stepn, for instance, is a pioneer with the move-to-earn model. We would suggest these protocols think carefully about the", "doc_id": "f98694d4-9e9e-4ff4-979d-042a685501c2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "38609218a9fb3c778803bfe5a712aa4a605ba569293f55e4f738164c2c5dad71", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1nmgU-kzJrcXGl6WcV_D9aH7px69MgBVyOM9cXD8ttwk"}, "node_info": {"start": 375447, "end": 390961}, "relationships": {"1": "c0ebcd15-ced6-4f72-803d-21e40faaf5e3", "2": "5ca905db-1a02-44d5-8aea-68b6bb7238e6", "3": "b6b48d45-b21a-4251-986b-e0e12f0a4cb3"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6b48d45-b21a-4251-986b-e0e12f0a4cb3": {"text": "better players) rather than rewarding the number of matches played.

Stepn, for instance, is a pioneer with the move-to-earn model. We would suggest these protocols think carefully about the types of value they want their tokenomics to incentivize and reward.\n\nFuture Ideas for Tokenomics\nSo far we have applied our principles retroactively, grading existing models on their performance. A useful design framework can also be applied proactively, allowing us to generate new ideas. In particular, how else might we deliver direct and targeted incentives to individual supporters of common goods?\nDecentralization: Miner honesty is heavily incentivized in practice, but miner diversity is rarely considered. But in theory, miner diversity \u2014 measured through ideas such as the Nakamoto coefficient \u2014 is well-understood as a form of common good. Would it make sense to impose a progressive tax on validator rewards above a certain stake size?\nMarketing: Awareness is critical to the survival of a protocol, so there is value to simply being first in the sense of providing initial liquidity or usage for a network. However, as with play-to-earn, participation driven by artificial rewards may be non-additive or harmful once the protocol attains critical mass. Could a protocol reward early backers by giving larger rewards to the first $X million TVL, then amortizing those bonuses as total liquidity rises? (APY already declines as TVL rises, so this would be a sharper tapering above some desired liquidity level.)\nGrants and partnerships: Token cap tables frequently include a large, open-ended allocation for developers who build for a protocol and partners who integrate with it. However, these rewards can be fairly diffuse and gameable. Would it be possible to tie grant-based token rewards to on-chain metrics in a non-exploitable way?\n\nConclusion\nToken design is difficult because it requires answering a highly abstract, open-ended question: what deserves to be incentivized? It would be ideal if protocols could try different models, solicit early feedback, and iterate. But most teams only get one chance to set the dynamics of the system and must provide a solid foundation on the first try. We believe that following these two core principles \u2014 creating common goods and aligning rewards \u2014 will give these teams the best chance of long-term success.\nThe burden falls on the broader community, too. Early investors, retail participants, and protocol users alike should push for strong and principled tokenomics \u2014 now more than ever. Many of the momentum-oriented designs of the last crypto bull market could only persist in such frothy markets. Despite their drawbacks, bear markets necessitate real utility from the start.\n\nPlease let us know if we missed anything \u2014 we are always aiming to engage with the crypto community and deepen our own understanding. Thanks to the research team at Jump Crypto and especially to Anirudh Suresh, Daniel Gerhardstein, and Maher Latif for feedback. This note does not constitute financial advice.\n\nWe use \"common goods\" rather than \"public goods\" because our focus is the economics of providing and maintaining collective resources. This often overlaps with the public/private distinction but is not strictly synonymous with it. In economic parlance, public goods specifically refer to goods that are non-rivalrous and non-excludable. In contrast, the definition of common goods is more concerned with embedding positive and negative externalities. These goods may also be non-rivalrous and non-excludable, but are not necessarily so. \u21a9\ufe0e\nGas fees are the fees participants pay to have their transactions included on the blockchain. These fees are incurred regardless of whether the transaction succeeds or fails. Moreover, these fees typically fluctuate with demand for limited block space, and most protocols utilize an auction mechanism to set prices. \u21a9\ufe0e\nIn its original sense, staking is the act of providing token collateral as part of a commitment to acting as an honest validator. The validator is rewarded for successful participation, but punished via loss of this stake for failure or malicious actions. In many proof-of-stake consensus systems, other participants are also allowed to entrust their stakes to validators (delegated staking) and share in the rewards. \u21a9\ufe0e\nIt is important to stress that liquidity does have common-good properties, because it allows use cases to be built atop the token. Our concern here is that OlympusDAO heavily over-incentivized the provision of liquidity, and in a manner that seemed duplicative with existing mechanisms. \u21a9\ufe0e\nDespite the substantial benefits of governance, we stress that governance is one of several components in a robust tokenomics model. Many protocols design their token solely to be used as a governance token. That narrow-minded focus misses many other core functions \u2014 from security to liquidity to marketing \u2014 required for a well-designed protocol. \u21a9\ufe0e\nThis third benefit is sometimes missed by protocols that utilize the one token/one vote model, as a handful of whales can effectively turn such protocols into oligarchic structures. One might consider this a form of \"soft rug.\" \u21a9\ufe0e\nIn Curve-like AMMs, voters are rewarded indirectly for their participation via additional fees allocated towards the target pools. This model does provide some form of individual value alignment, but at the cost of disincentivizing good collective governance, as voters are incentivized to selfishly vote towards their own pools or the ones offering the highest bribe. On Solidly, another Curve-like AMM, voters instead earn fees from all pools they vote for. This encourages a better equilibrium where users vote for pools that generate high fees, which are presumably those that provide high utility. \u21a9\ufe0e\nRegular governance and voting escrow deliver the same set of common good benefits, but ve models provide more substantial value alignment. This is because the most empowered voters \"pay for\" their power with longer lockups, committing to stick around and enjoy the benefits or suffer the consequences of their choices. \u21a9\ufe0e\nCoordinated activity (e.g. guilds) will arise in either scenario, but they will behave very differently depending on the exact behavior rewarded and the difficulty of exploiting the corresponding metric. \u21a9\ufe0e\nShare\nContributors\n\nLucas Baker\nLucas is an investor and researcher at Jump, where he focuses on protocol and mechanism design, tokenomics and governance, decentralized identity, and core L1/L2 blockchain infrastructure.\n.View all posts (5)\n\nNihar Shah\nNihar is a Researcher focused on token & mechanism design.
